        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Enterobacteriaceae may be a cause of cSSSI in patients with underlying comorbid illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, and require empiric therapy with broad spectrum antibacterials. We used pooled data from 2 cSSSI trials to compare the clinical and microbiological efficacy of sequential IV/PO moxifloxacin (MXF) with comparator (COMP) therapy in patients with cSSSI due to Enterobacteriaceae.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Data were pooled from 2 sequential (IV/PO) trials of MXF in the treatment of cSSSI in hospitalized patients. COMP treatment consisted of IV piperacillin-tazobactam followed by PO amoxicillin/clavulanate (North America) and sequential IV/PO amoxicillin/clavulanate (Europe).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The 2 trials enrolled 1421 patients (712 MXF, 709 COMP) of which 999 were valid for the per protocol analysis (495 MXF, 504 COMP). Of these patients, 286 (57.8%) MXF and 291 (57.7%) COMP-treated subjects were also microbiologically valid. Of these, 87 (30.4%) MXF and 77 (26.5%) COMP-treated subjects had Enterobacteriaceae isolated from their skin infection sites. The table shows the isolated organisms, and the overall clinical and bacteriological success rates at test-of-cure (10&#x02013;42 days and 14&#x02013;28 days post treatment for the North American and European trials respectively) among patients valid for the per protocol analysis with a positive skin culture for Enterobacteriaceae.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Enterobacteriaceae were cultured frequently from hospitalised patients with cSSSI. Monotherapy therapy with IV/PO MXF had similar clinical and bacteriological efficacy as the standard treatment regimens in the management of cSSSI due to Enterobacteriaceae.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Although the risk of deep infection with primary total hip and knee arthroplasty is small, when such a complication does occur the patient can suffer great morbidity. Prevention of infection is paramount and in this regard the practice of adding antibiotic to the orthopaedic bone cement is gaining popularity. Despite the potential benefits of antibiotic bone cement (ABC) for joint arthroplasty, controversies remain regarding its use due to a lack of well designed studies of adequate size. We sought to quantify the use of ABC for prophylaxis of primary hip and knee arthoplasties and to determine variance of practice amongst orthopaedic surgeons.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Fifteen orthopaedic surgeons who most frequently perform joint arthoplasties were identified. The medical records of adult patients who received a primary, cemented total hip or knee joint replacement between March and May 2005 were screened based on the orthopaedic surgeon who performed the procedure. Eight consecutive charts for each orthopaedic surgeon underwent a formal chart review.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Eleven out of the 14 orthopaedic surgeons (79%) used some type of ABC for primary arthroplasty. Analysis of 109 patient charts revealed that 60% of patients received ABC during their primary total joint replacement in addition to standard systemic prophylaxis. Three types of commercially available ABC were used containing either gentamicin (0.5g or 1g) per 40g cement or more commonly, tobramycin 1g per 40g cement. No extemporaneously-made high-dose ABC was used for primary arthoplasty in the patient sample. The practice of using ABC varied widely amongst the individual orthopaedic surgeons. In this small chart review, orthopaedic surgeons did not appear to select ABC based on immune status factors of their patients that are thought to increase the risk of infection.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Orthopaedic surgeons do not have a common practice for using antibiotics in bone cement for primary total hip or total knee arthroplasty in our region. Given the lack of guidelines on this issue and the incessant demand for total joint arthoplasty, more collaborative dialogue and study are needed to assess the worth of ABC as additional prophylaxis.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Antibiotic consumption is increasingly recognized as a main driver for resistance. Surveillance of antimicrobial consumption is important for public health planning and evaluation. In this paper, we compared the oral antimicrobial consumption derived from two different methodologies in British Columbia (BC).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Consumption data were obtained from PharmaNet and CompuScript databases. PharmaNet, maintained by the BC College of Pharmacists, contains all individual prescription dispensed in retail pharmacy stores including internet pharmacies. CompuScript is privately owned by IMS Health where prescription data (exclusion of internet pharmacies and veterinary use) are estimated from stratified sampling across BC. Antimicrobials were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical (ATC) Classification system and converted to a rate of daily defined dose (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day. Data were aggregated by month from January 2000 to May 2005 for all oral antibiotics by each ATC classification were calculated. The consumption rates from these two databases were compared by calculating the percentage difference (and 95% confidence intervals) of CompuScript from PharmaNet for each major ATC classes.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>CompuScript antibiotic consumption rates followed the same trend and were parallel to PharmaNet rates. However, CompuScript estimates were consistently higher than PharmaNet for all major ATC classes. When evaluating all PharmaNet records with the exclusion of veterinary and physician office bulk purchase, macrolides class (J01F) showed the smallest mean difference (3% with 95% CI:2.7%, 4.0%) whereas the highest discrepancy (7% with 95% CI:6.5%, 7.7%) was found in penicillins class (J01C). For overall antibiotic (J01), the mean difference was 3.6 (95% CI:3.1%, 4.7%).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>CompuScript and PharmaNet provide comparable oral antibiotic consumption rates. Although CompuScript may overestimate the consumption rates, it could serve as a closer-to-real-time surrogate with easier data access. However, PharmaNet data have the advantage of being potentially linkable with billing and other data to allow for individual level assessment and evaluation of reasons for prescription.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To compare the Innovotech bioFILM PA susceptibility kit designed for planktonic and sessile susceptibility testing with standard broth micro-dilution (BMD) susceptibility testing of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA) isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>25 strains of PA isolated from CF patients were tested by CLSI BMD for susceptibility. The same strains were then tested with the Innovotech bioFILM PA kit. A standard inoculum was made in trypticase soy broth (TSB) and inoculated into wells of the Innovotech bioFILM PA kit. The sessile inoculating 96 peg lid was rocked gently on a rocker for 4&#x02013;6 hours at 35&#x000b0;C. The sessile lid was then placed into a MIC tray containing anti-pseudomonal antimicrobials in cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CAMHB) at CLSI breakpoint concentrations. This tray also contained combinations of agents commonly used for PA therapy. After overnight incubation, the planktonic susceptibility was recorded, the sessile lid was rinsed and then placed on a second recovery tray containing CAMHB. After overnight incubation, biofilm susceptibilities were determined.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>CLSI BMD MICs and Innovotech planktonic breakpoints (S, I, R) were within the same range. The sessile MICs were often greater than for the planktonic forms. Tobramycin combined with colistin, ciprofloxacin or meropenem were active against many of the biofilm cultures. When tested alone, standard planktonic MICs often indicated resistance to these agents. The breakpoints of susceptible combinations were within ranges clinically achievable with standard therapeutic doses of these agents.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>These first attempts to utilize a susceptibility test system (Innovotech bioFILM PA kit) that better mimics the biofilms of PA in the respiratory tract of CF patients provide early support for the use of this device to assist with appropriate antimicrobial therapy in these patients.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To describe testing results and outcome of lookbacks on donors who test repeat reactive (RR) for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) at Canadian Blood Services (CBS).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>CBS routinely screens all blood donors for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). On April 9, 2005, CBS implemented anti-HBc screening, using the Abbott PRISM HBCore assay. Any repeat reactive anti-HBc donor specimen was further tested using two supplemental assays: antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and hepatitis B DNA (HBV DNA) using the Abbott AUSAB EIA and Roche HBV DNA assays respectively. Lookbacks were performed for all donations from HBV DNA positive repeat donors. Attempts were made to obtain hepatitis B serological test results, and hepatitis B vaccination status of recipients. Follow up hepatitis B sequencing and viral load is currently being performed on HBV DNA and HBSAg positive donors who agree to be tested.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>From April 9, 2005 to August 31, 2006, 1,331,413 blood donors were screened for anti-HBc. 6,026 (0.45%) donors were screen RR for anti-HBc. Of these, 85% for whom serum was available for testing were anti-HBs reactive. 29 (0.002%) donors were HBV DNA positive. Lookback on 26 DNA positive repeat donors (the remainder were first time donors) identified 256 transfused components to 79 (74 living, 5 deceased) recipients for whom hepatitis B test results were available.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Anti-HBc screening has identified 26 repeat donors who would not have been identified by HBsAg screening, and who potentially pose a risk for transfusion transmission of hepatitis B. To date, in recipients for whom hepatitis B serology results are available, there is not conclusive evidence that hepatitis B transmission has occurred.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Evidence suggests that the genotype and mutant status of hepatitis B virus (HBV) may have important implications for the clinical and treatment outcome of infected patients. The present study aimed to characterize the HBV genotype and precore/core promoter-coding region of HBV strains circulating in Canada from 2001 to 2005 from acutely- and chronically-infected individuals.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Serum samples submitted for HBV molecular diagnostic testing (from BC, AB, SK, MB, and NS for acute samples; from BC, MB, ON, QC, NB, and NS for chronic samples) were analyzed. RFLP and sequence analysis were performed to determine the presence of a mutation at nucleotides 1896 (precore mutation) and 1762/1764 (core promoter mutation) of the HBV genome. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses were performed to determine the genotype of each HBV isolate.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Sera from 245 persons acutely infected with HBV and 468 persons chronically infected with HBV were investigated. The majority of acute hepatitis B cases were genotype D (57.9%), followed by genotype A (20.8%). In contrast, preliminary evidence shows that Canadian chronic HBV carriers are infected with genotypes A, B, C, and D in nearly equal numbers (21.3%, 18.6%, 29.4%, 21.1%, respectively). All 8 genotypes of HBV, including mixed genotype infections, were detected in both acute and chronic populations. Risk factor information obtained for 70 of the acute HBV cases from BC indicated that injection drug use and previous incarceration were significantly associated with genotype D HBV infection. The precore and core promoter mutations were highly prevalent in the chronic HBV population (34% and 44%, respectively), whereas they were less prevalent in the acutely infected population (5% and 8%, respectively, p&#x0003c;0.01).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>HBV genotypes are known to have a distinct geographic distribution. In Canada, all 8 HBV genotypes were observed due to our large and varied immigrant population. Proportions of genotypes were not equal between acute and chronic groups. Although precore and core promoter mutations were prevalent in the chronic population, their small number in the acute HBV population suggests that such strains are not readily transmissible.</p>

        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>HGV prevalence was higher in NHL cases than controls and the difference was significant for males but not females. While a higher proportion of cases who received blood products were HGV RNA positive, the increased prevalence of HGV RNA observed in male NHL cases was independent of the receipt of blood products. If the association between HGV and NHL is confirmed, these findings have important implications for blood safety.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To assess the performance of the OraSure&#x02122; device for the detection of antibodies to HIV and HCV in oral fluid (OF).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>The study population consisted of 110 subjects of known HIV and HCV status, 29 HIV+/HCV+; 27 HIV+/HCV&#x02212;; 24 HIV&#x02212;/HCV+; and 30 HIV&#x02212;/HCV&#x02212;. Each subject provided two OF samples (one from each side of the mouth) and a blood sample. Serum and OF (extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions) aliquots were stored at &#x02212;70C Serum and one randomly selected OF from each subject were tested for anti-HIV-1&#x00026;2 and anti-HCV on the Bayer ADVIA Centaur&#x02122; system according to the protocol for serum (ie, no modification for OF). OF were also tested for anti-HCV with the Ortho&#x02122; HCV 3.0 ELISA SAVe according to a modified method for OF.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Anti-HIV was detected in OF by the Bayer assay in 54/56 subjects (sensitivity 96.4%) who were HIV seropositive and in 4/22 subjects who were HCV seropositive (sensitivity 18.2%). Anti-HCV in OF was detected by the Ortho assay in 53/56 subjects (sensitivity 94.6%) who were HCV seropositive. Anti-HCV (0/52) and anti-HIV (0/53) were not detected in OF from any seronegative subjects (specificity 100%). One subject was excluded from the analysis as no serum was collected. Of note, 6 subjects thought to be HCV seronegative at recruitment were found to be seropositive (5/6 were also positive in OF). In addition, of two subjects thought to be HCV seropositive at recruitment, one was shown to be anti-HCV equivocal and one was negative in serum; both were anti-HCV negative in OF.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>The Bayer ADVIA Centaur&#x02122; system has good sensitivity without procedure modification for the detection of anti-HIV in OF, but the sensitivity of this system is poor for the detection of anti-HCV in OF. The Ortho HCV 3.0 ELISA&#x02122; has good sensitivity for anti-HCV detection in OF. The results demonstrate that OF collected with the OraSure&#x02122; device can be used successfully for HIV and HCV epidemiological investigations.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To perform semi-annual surveillance of fusidic acid (FA) susceptibility of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains isolated from four Canadian laboratories.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>
          <italic>S aureus</italic> strains were collected from routine cultures submitted to four diagnostic laboratories during March and September over the past year. Sixty (60) strains were collected from each of the four sites; 10 of these strains were methicillin resistant (MRSA) isolates. Only one strain per patient was tested in each test period. Testing for FA susceptibility was performed by disk diffusion (Oxoid, Nepean, Ontario) and Etest&#x000ae; (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on Mueller Hinton agar plates. The plates were incubated at 35&#x000b0;C for 18&#x02013;20 hr in ambient air. A FA zone diameter of &#x0003e; 20 mm was considered susceptible. ETest&#x000ae; MICs were recorded. MICs of &#x02265;2 mg/L usually have a resistant determinant. CLSI breakpoints have not been established for FA.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>479 <italic>S aureus</italic> strains were tested for FA susceptibility in 2006, including 80 MRSA strains. 148/479 (31%) of strains were collected from inpatients and 331/479 (69%) from outpatients. 19/240 (8%) were resistant to FA in March and 18/239 (8%) in September. Only 1 strain of MRSA was resistant to FA. The 37 strains resistant by disk diffusion (&#x02264; 19 mm) all had MIC &#x02265; 4 mg/L. One strain borderline by disk diffusion (20 mm) had an MIC of 4 mg/L.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Fusidic acid is the most widely prescribed topical antimicrobial in Canada. These ongoing surveillance data show that there has been no trend towards increasing FA resistance in centers across Canada. This is true even among MRSA strains that are unrelated to defined outbreaks of infection. These data support the importance of continuing surveillance and suggest that fusidic acid has maintained its efficacy over the years.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Many northern Canadian remote communities face high infectious disease rates. In northern Saskatchewan communities, approximately 90% of patients who visit primary care practitioners with symptoms suggestive of acute infection are prescribed antibiotics without laboratory investigation of their illness. The Northern Antibiotic Resistance Partnership (NARP) has among its goals to increase appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing and to determine the effect of this intervention on antimicrobial resistance in isolates from northern communities. One of the components of NARP is an active surveillance study in three northern Saskatchewan communities.</p>

        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>From late October 2005, specimens were collected from urinary tract infections (UTI), pharyngitis (URT), pneumonia (LRTI) and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>In the first year of this study, 1923 isolates were considered significant (51% from UTI, 35%, SSTI 11% URTI, 3% LRTI). Marked differences were seen in distribution of predominant pathogens bacteria between the sites. From UTI, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was frequently isolated, but at one site, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> was more common than <italic>E coli</italic>. SSTI most often yielded <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, of which 56% were MRSA, and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Antimicrobial susceptibilities from the first year of this study are being used for the development of empirical treatment guidelines for these common syndromes and provide a baseline for assessing the effectiveness of interventions during the NARP study.</p>

        <p>Beijing strains of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> were first documented in Beijing, China, but have since been found to exist globally. These strains are known to cause multidrug resistant outbreaks, thereby necessitating the development of accurate and precise identification methods.

        <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
        <p>Real time PCR using ABI 7000 (Hillemann et al 2005) and conventional PCR (Rao et al 2006) using agarose gel electrophoresis analysis were compared to <italic>IS</italic>6110-RFLP. Positive real time PCR result was identified by the presence of the amplification curve. For conventional PCR, a band of 642bp observed in agarose gel was indicative of the positive Beijing strain.</p>

        <title>RESULT</title>
        <p>By using the BioNumerics clustering analysis, 217 isolates were identified being related to the Beijing family by <italic>IS</italic>6110-RFLP and 4 categories of relatedness were generated. The number of positive samples in each category is shown in the following table by different methods of identification.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>
          <italic>IS</italic>6110-RFLP is a lengthy, labour intensive assay with limited number of samples being processed at one time. However, with real time PCR using ABI 3100, around 90 samples can be easily screened within a day as compared to 2 days for conventional PCR. Previous data published by Hillemann et al and Rao et al indicated that all Beijing strains were identifed by real time or conventional PCR using their specified primer sets for amplification. However, this study showed that there were discrepant results between the 2 assays. Spoligotyping, the original method for identifying Beijing families is required to confirm which of these discordant results are correct.

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The identification non-tuberculosis Mycobacteria (NTM) isolates is routinely performed using probe hybridization or biochemical analysis. However, these phenotypic assays often fail to identify or differentiate some species of NTM resulting in misidentification of the organism. The turn around time for reporting is lengthy especially with the slow growers. To address these limitations, we undertook an evaluation of pyrosequencing technology for the identification of NTM. Pyrosequencing is a novel DNA sequencing method and is based on a chemiluminescent enzymatic reaction. When individual nucleotide complementary to the single strand of DNA is incorporated, a cascade of enzymatic reactions is triggered and results in a light signal. This evaluation included a) an optimization of the assay using selective strains, b) the building of a pyrosequencing database for NTM using reference strains and c) identification of clinical isolates that were previously identified using routine phenotypic biochemical analysis.</p>

        <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
        <p>The NTM isolates were treated with lysozyme overnight and followed by extraction using the GC12 (PSS Biosystem), an automated extractor using magnetic based beads. PCR was performed using biotinylated PCR primers followed by pyrosequencing using the PyroMark MOTT ASR kit (Biotage, LLC). All sequences generated from the NTM reference strains were entered into the NTM pyrosequencing database library. Clinical NTM isolates were identified using the reference library.</p>

        <title>RESULT</title>
        <p>
          <italic>M triviale</italic> (ATCC 23292) and <italic>M chelonae</italic> (ATCC 35752), used for the optimization of the assay, showed that 20ng of PCR amplified DNA is required to generate the pyrogram. Pyrosequencing data of 47 NTM references strains were included in the library. One hundred and twenty three clinical isolates previously identified to the species level via phenotypic analysis were also identified by pyrosequencing. All sequences were checked against GenBank and Ridom databases for sequence confirmation.

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Pyrosequencing is an excellent assay for the identification of NTM. The PCR amplified product is approximately 50&#x02013;80 bp of which 50 bases are sequenced. Both PCR and sequencing can be performed in a 96 well format with a possible turn around time for reporting of within 48h. This assay is very rapid as compared to the conventional methods. All Beijing strains were identifed by real time or conventional PCR using their specified primer sets for amplification. However, this study showed that there were discrepant results between the 2 assays. Spoligotyping, the original method for identifying Beijing families is required to confirm which of these discordant results are correct.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>To systematically review the literature to assess whether adjunctive therapy with polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) reduces mortality among critically ill adults with severe sepsis and septic shock.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating IVIG treatment in critically ill adults with severe sepsis or septic shock were searched for using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases, the meta-register of controlled trials, and the medical editors trial amnesty register. Two reviewers independently conducted assessment of suitability for inclusion, assessed their validity, and extracted data. The main outcome of interest was the effect of IVIG on all-cause mortality and was quantified using a fixed-effect meta-analysis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Fourteen RCTs published between 1988 and 2006 were included. Most were small, utilized relatively low doses of IVIG, and included predominantly surgical patients with Gram-negative infections. There was a significant reduction in mortality associated with use of IVIG treatment with a pooled odds ratio of 0.66 (95% confidence interval (CI); 0.53&#x02013;0.83; p&#x0003c;0.0005). In general, a greater treatment effect was seen among studies of lower methodological quality, using higher doses of IVIG, and those that did not use albumin as a control. There was evidence of between study heterogeneity (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> p=0.009) and this was at least moderate as measured by the <italic>I</italic>
          <italic>
            <sup>2</sup>
          </italic> value (<italic>I</italic>
          <italic>
            <sup>2</sup>
          </italic>=53.8%). When only high quality studies were pooled the OR for mortality was 0.96 (95% CI; 0.71 to 1.3; p=0.78).
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>This meta-analysis demonstrates an overall reduction in mortality with the use of IVIG for the adjunctive treatment severe sepsis and septic shock in adults although significant heterogeneity exists among the included trials and this result was not confirmed when only high quality studies were analyzed. These data warrant a well designed, adequately powered and transparently reported, clinical trial.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rare cardio-pulmonary disease caused by viruses of the genus <italic>Hantavirus</italic>, for which rodents are the natural reservoir. Rodents shed the virus in excreta such as urine and people are usually infected when they inhale aerosolized infectious material. This is a report of the first human case of HPS acquired in Quebec.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A 50 year old man with no history of medical problems was admitted in May 2004 to an emergency clinic with symptoms compatible with an atypical pneumonia. Smears, bronchial lavage and endo-tracheal secretions were examined. Sera were collected and tested for antibodies to a variety of infectious agents. In addition, a serological survey of small mammals was conducted in the suspected area of human exposure to hantavirus near La Tuque, Quebec.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Examination of the smears showed a presence of lymphocytes, polynuclear cells and inflammatory mesothelial cells. Microscopy and cultures from the endotracheal secretions failed to detect any evidence of fungal infection. Sera tested for <italic>Legionella</italic>, <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, <italic>Mycoplasma pneumonia</italic>, <italic>Histoplasma</italic>, <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic>, adenovirus, echo-Coxsackie viruses and HIV were all negative. Hantavirus-specific IgM antibodies were detected by Western Blot on the acute serum. In addition, titres of IgG antibodies detected by ELISA (1:102,400) and plaque reduction neutralization test (1:10,240) were unusually high. Hantavirus-specific antibodies were detected in 2 of 34 captured deer mice, <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic> (5.9%), and viral RNA was detected in tissues from one of the two seropositive animals. In contrast, 0 of 33 captured red-backed voles, <italic>Clethrionomys gapperi</italic>, had evidence of hantavirus infection.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>The patient had not travelled outside Quebec in the last 20 years. Exposure to hantaviruses likely occurred when several buildings on a recreational property, which were noted to be infested with deer mice, were cleaned without respiratory protection. Phylogenetic analysis of viral RNA from deer mice showed significant identity with Sin Nombre virus genotypes previously reported in Quebec. The results of this study confirm that this is the first reported case of locally acquired HPS in Quebec.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) is indicated in all transplant recipients, but a standard single dose of PPV has low immunogenicity. A two-dose strategy using pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) to prime the immune system followed by a booster of standard PPV (prime-boost strategy) may be more immunogenic. We conducted a randomized double blind, placebo-controlled trial of priming with PCV before polysaccharide vaccination.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Stable adult liver transplant recipients &#x0003e; 3 months post-transplant were randomized to either a prime-boost vaccination strategy (PCV followed by PPV 8-weeks later) or a standard vaccination strategy (placebo followed by PPV 8-weeks later). Serum was obtained for ELISA testing for each of the seven serotypes contained in PCV at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. Serotype-specific geometric mean titers (GMTs, &#x003bc;g/mL) at week 8 and 16 were compared in the two groups. Also, serotype specific opsonophagocytic assays (OPA) were performed at baseline and 16 weeks.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>50 liver transplant recipients were enrolled (24 PCV-PPV and 26 placebo-PPV). Baseline demographics, underlying disease, time from transplant and immunosuppressive regimens were similar in the two groups. Local adverse reactions were similar at 16 weeks in both groups. There was no significant difference in rejection rates at 8 and 16 week follow-up. At week 8, the PCV group had a significant rise in GMTs compared to placebo (P&#x0003c;0.001 for all serotypes). At week 16, the following GMTs were noted in the PCV-PPV vs placebo-PPV groups: 2.56 vs 0.78 (ser 4), 3.83 vs 2.49 (ser 6B), 3.00 vs 2.74 (ser 9V), 15.7 vs 10.9 (ser 14), 4.46 vs 4.33 (ser 18C), 5.38 vs 4.81 (ser 19F), 3.37 vs 1.34 (ser 23F), p=NS for all comparisons. In the PCV-PPV group, there was no significant change in GMTs after the PPV dose except for serotype 14 (10.6 at week 8 vs 15.7 at week 16, p=0.01). There was no significant difference in number of subjects attaining a &#x02265;4-fold rise in OPA titre between the two groups for any serotype.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>This interim data shows that a two-dose prime-boost vaccination strategy using pneumococcal conjugate vaccine resulted in no incremental benefit compared to the administration of either conjugate vaccine alone or polysaccharide vaccine alone, as measured by serotype specific ELISA responses and opsonophagocytic activity</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>There is controversy over the effectiveness of the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPV) in preventing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and PPV remains underused. Some suggest prior PPV might also lead to better outcomes in CAP patients, because partial immunity attenuates disease. Using a population-based cohort of patients hospitalized with CAP, we determined whether prior PPV resulted in reduced in-hospital mortality or need for ICU admission.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>From 2000&#x02013;2002, comprehensive clinical and laboratory data were prospectively collected on all adults with CAP admitted to six hospitals. PPV status was ascertained by interview, chart review, contact with family physicians and with the office of community health for the region. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality or ICU admission. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent association between PPV use and outcomes, after controlling for patient characteristics, comorbidities, CAP severity (using the PSI), and propensity (to receive PPV) scores.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The 3415 patients hospitalized with CAP had a median age of 75 years, 46% were female, 31% had COPD, 19% were from nursing homes, 62% had severe pneumonia (PSI Class IV/V), and 760 (22%) had received prior PPV. Overall, 624 patients died or were admitted to ICU; PPV was protective from reaching this composite endpoint (73/760 [10%] vs 551/2655 [21%] for unvaccinated patients, p&#x0003c;0.001). In multivariable models that included propensity scores, the adjusted odds of death or ICU admission was 0.62 (95%CI 0.42&#x02013;0.93, p=0.02) for patients who had received prior PPV. Among those who had blood cultures drawn (n=2350), rates of pneumococcal bacteremia were significantly lower among those who had received PPV (2% vs 5% for unvaccinated patients, p=0.004).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Patients with CAP who had prior PPV had about a 40% lower adjusted rate of mortality or ICU admission compared with those who were not vaccinated. This provides additional support for recommendations to administer PPV to those at risk of pneumonia.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>In our region, the use of caspofungin, voriconazole, and Lipid Amphotericin B products (new antifungals, NAF) is restricted to patients who have difficulty tolerating, or whose pathogen is resistant to standard antifungal therapy (SAF) with Amphotericin B or fluconazole This study describes NAF utilization and adherence with local guidelines.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Hospital pharmacy databases were used to identify patients &#x0003e;18 years receiving NAF between October 2002 and May 2006. An ethics approved retrospective chart review collected data on patient demographics, fungal diagnosis, risk factors for fungal infection, renal function, micro-biologic, radiologic and histologic evidence of infection, treatment rationale, and outcomes.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>There were 91 patients (of 103 eligible) with charts available, with 64 requiring ICU admission and 31 deaths. There were 107 NAF</p>
        <p>utilization events: 39 voriconazole, 57 caspofungin, 7 lipid amphotericin B, and 4 with &#x0003e;1 NAF. The median age was 57 years, and 59.3% were female. The most common diagnoses were GI surgery (27), acute leukemia and other hematologic malignancies (22), solid organ transplant (21), and other malignancies (5). Other risks included broad spectrum antibiotics (89), central lines (74), TPN (49), and immunosuppressants (42), with 85.5% having &#x02265;3 risk factors. The most common infection sites (identified by treating physicians) were lung (43), blood (31), and urinary tract (22). There were 110 fungal isolates, 38.2% <italic>C albicans</italic>, 36.4% non-albicans candida, 22.8% <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp, and 2.7% other. 18 (16.4%) of the patients had tripling of their baseline creatinine, or Cr&#x02265;250 (the criteria used to define renal intolerance of Amphotericin B therapy). Fifty (45.5%) of the patients had 2X&#x02191; creatinine, Cr&#x02265;150, or were on concomitant nephrotoxic drugs (new criteria, November 2006). There was 8.3% compliance with the restriction form, and an ID consultant either approved or did not suggest NAF discontinuation in 75.2% of instances.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Over 80% of patients did not meet renal criteria and overall criteria for NAF use. The patients were complex, immunosup-pressed individuals with in hospital mortality of 34.1%, with fungal infection contributing to 15% overall. In our region there is a need to develop a new process to rationalize and target NAF use to the most appropriate patients.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>CA-MRSA strains with SCC<italic>mec</italic> Type IVa have been reported as an emerging nosocomial pathogen in the United States but to date no cases have been reported in Canada. We investigated a series of potential nosocomial infections secondary to apparent CA-MRSA in the Calgary Health Region over the past 2 years.</p>

        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Patients who presented with hospital acquired MRSA infection (&#x02265; 72 hours post admission) with an antibiogram pattern typical of other CA-MRSA strains seen within the CHR were identified by experienced infection control personnel. These patients were assessed in more detail using chart review and/or personal interview to determine the presence or absence of known risk factors for CA-MRSA. MRSA strains were identified using standard laboratory procedures (Gram stain, catalase and tube coagulase) and confirmed by an in-house PCR assay for <italic>nuc</italic>, <italic>femA</italic>, and <italic>mecA</italic> genes. A triplex PCR assay which detects <italic>lukS-PV</italic> and <italic>lukF-PV</italic> genes was used to identify the presence of PVL. Isolates were typed for SCC<italic>mec</italic> using a multiplex PCR typing assay which could classify the isolates into subtypes I, II, III, IVa-d and V. The identification of strains matching the MRSA USA300 (CMRSA10) or USA400 (CMRSA 7) strain was based on pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns and the presence of PVL and SCC<italic>mec</italic> type IVa using appropriate control strains. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed according to the method of Enright.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Of 14 patients identified to date, 8 did not have other identifiable risk factors for CA-MRSA (drug use, incarceration, homelessness, shelter living, aboriginal). The major risk factors identified were drug use and/or homelessness. Seven of the strains were PFGE pattern CMRSA 10 (USA 300) and one was CMRSA 7. The isolates were identified at a mean of 19.7 days after admission (range 7&#x02013;45 days) in the 8 patients ranging in ages from 49&#x02013;90. The nosocomial infections were significant with 5 soft tissue infections (cellulitis, abscess), 2 bacteremias and 1 pneumonia. The CMRSA 10 strains were all PVL +, Scc<italic>mec</italic> Type IVa and MLST: ST8 (3-3-1-1-4-4-3). All strains were TMP-SMX and clindamycin susceptible but 2 of the latter had inducible resistance.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Nosocomial infection 2&#x000b0; to CA-MRSA has emerged in the CHR and other centres should be alert to this possibility. In our limited series, the identification of hospital acquired CA-MRSA has been associated with significant morbidity.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Extensive use of mupirocin is associated with the emergence of mupirocin resistance. This study describes the epidemiology and laboratory characterization of mupirocin-resistant methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) in Canadian hospitals.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 5,075 MRSA isolates from CNISP hospitals between 1995&#x02013;2004 was done in accordance with CLSI guidelines. Mupirocin susceptibility (MupS) was defined as an MIC =4 &#x003bc;g/ml; low-level resistance was defined as an MIC 8-256 &#x003bc;g/ml; high-level resistance (MupR) was an MIC =512 &#x003bc;g/ml. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and SCC<italic>
            <sub>mec</sub>
          </italic> typing were performed. PCR was done to detect the presence of the <italic>mupA</italic> gene; plasmid DNA was extracted from strains with <italic>mupA</italic>. Clinical and epidemiologic features of patients with MupR MRSA were compared to those with MupS MRSA.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>MupR MRSA rates increased from 1.6% in the first 5 years of surveillance to 7.0% in 2000&#x02013;2004 (p&#x0003c;0.001). Most of the increase occurred in Ontario and Quebec. PFGE and SCC<italic>
            <sub>mec</sub>
          </italic> typing revealed that the most common (38%) MupR MRSA was CMRSA-2 (resembling USA100), carrying the SCC<italic>
            <sub>mec</sub>
          </italic> type II. All MupR MRSA had a plasmid-associated <italic>mupA</italic> gene. The <italic>mupA</italic> gene was not detected in MRSA with low-level mupirocin resistance or in MupS strains. Clinical and epidemi-ologic data were available for 139 patients with MupR MRSA and for 3,187 patients with MupS strains. As compared to those with MupS strains, patients with MupR MRSA were more likely to be First Nations (OR 6.3, 95% CI 3.7&#x02013;10.7; p&#x0003c;0.001), and to have had a community-associated isolate (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4&#x02013;4.6; p=0.008); MupR MRSA were less likely to have been recovered from blood (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06&#x02013;0.96; p=0.03) or from respiratory cultures (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35&#x02013;0.96; p=0.03).

      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The incidence of MupR is increasing in Canadian strains of MRSA. The resistance is plasmid mediated and associated with the presence of the <italic>mupA</italic> gene in isolates from across the country. MupR MRSA is recovered from patients with distinct clinical and epidemiologic characteristics, as compared to those with MupS MRSA.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The predominant CA-MRSA strains in North America are USA300 and USA400. However, there are no specific animal models described for studying the pathogenic propensity of newly emerging CA-MRSA. We recently developed a murine model capable of demonstrating dermatopathological differences between these strains.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Three representative strains were selected for testing: C2406 (USA300), CMRSA-7 (USA400) and M92 (colonization strain). Strains were typed with PFGE, MLST, SCC<italic>mec</italic>, <italic>spa</italic> and <italic>agr</italic>. Profiling of 25 virulence genes was conducted using PCR assays. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by standard procedures. For the animal model, after intra-dermal injection with bacteria, female BALB/c mice were carefully monitored for skin and systemic infection and euthanized on days 2, 4, 8, and 14. Spleens were aseptically harvested for quantitative cultures to determine bacterial load. Full thickness biopsies of the core cutaneous lesions were performed and subjected to detailed histopathological examination.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Molecular typing revealed different genetic profiles of these 3 strains: USA300 (ST8-MRSA-Iva) with <italic>spa</italic> t008, <italic>agr</italic> I &#x00026; PVL(+); USA400 (ST1-MRSA-Iva) with <italic>spa</italic> t128, <italic>agr</italic> III &#x00026; PVL(+); M92 (ST239-MRSA-II) with <italic>spa</italic> t004, <italic>agr</italic> I &#x00026; PVL(&#x02212;). The USA300 and USA400 strains showed typical CA-MRSA susceptibility profiles, whilst M92 revealed typical HA-MRSA susceptibility profiles. Virulence gene analysis revealed a predominance of adhesion genes in USA300 whilst enterotoxin genes were found predominantly in USA400. In this model, no systemic infection was observed. Intradermally-induced murine infections caused by USA300 uniformly presented as extensive open lesions with a histologically-documented profound neutrophilic inflammatory response extending below the fascia, although all mice demonstrated evidence of wound healing after a 14-day period. In contrast, infections caused by USA400 or M92 always presented with localized cutaneous infections associated with a focal inflammatory response and no skin ulceration.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>We were able to demonstrate some of the key clinical and epidemiological differences between different MRSA in a murine intradermal infection model useful for studying the pathogenicity of newly emerging CA-MRSA strains.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND</title>
        <p>IDI-MRSA is the only approved PCR assay for the direct detection of MRSA nasal colonization. An updated assay was introduced in March 2006 to improve the positive predictive value (PPV).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The objective of this study was to compare the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and negative predictive value (NPV) of version 2 (V2) and version 3 (V3) of the assay.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>From October 2005 to November 2006, samples were prospectively collected using charcoal Amies-gel swabs on selected high risk patients. Swabs were first inoculated onto selective media and then processed for PCR according to manufacturer instructions (non-nasal sites were processed as nasals). PCR+/culture&#x02013; samples were defined as true positives (TP) if broth enrichment (BE) culture was positive or the patient was found to be MRSA culture-positive from another same-day specimen.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A total of 836 nasal, 835 rectal, and 140 &#x02018;other&#x02019; specimens were tested from 723 patients. The sensitivity, specificity and NPV of the two versions did not differ significantly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jidmm18035">Table</xref>). V3 PPV did not significantly differ from that of V2 (P=0.27). Of the 107 TP (by defined criteria), 19 were negative on direct culture. Inhibition was noted in 124 (7%) samples and did not differ between versions. Inhibition in rectal swabs, 101/835, was significantly higher than non-rectal swabs 23/976, p&#x0003c;0.0002. Interestingly, in 14/62 (23%) positive patients, MRSA was only found in non-nasal swabs.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Despite the introduction of an updated IDI-MRSA assay version designed to reduce false positives, the new version continues to have a relatively low PPV. The causes of the continued false positives need to be further investigated. We also note that molecular screening for MRSA should not rely solely on nasal specimens.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Implementation of isolation precautions for patients with Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) is dependent upon rapid communication of detection of MRSA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Turn-Around-Time (TAT) of MRSASelect&#x02122; chromogenic medium (implemented in 2006) for detection of MRSA compared to the TAT for Mannitol Salt agar containing 6 ug/mL Oxacillin (MSA-Ox), which was the medium previously used for MRSA surveillance.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>The TAT analysis evaluated 6 months of samples submitted for MRSA surveillance in 2005 and 6 months of samples submitted in 2006. In 2005 surveillance samples were screened using MSA-Ox media prepared by the lab. In 2006 surveillance samples were screened using MRSASelect&#x02122; that was purchased from Bio-Rad Canada as prepared plates. The data from both periods were stratified by specimen type to determine if there were any differences.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Prior to 2006 the Manitoba Provincial guidelines had indicated that surveillance cultures for MRSA should include samples from; nares, sputum or throat, wounds, invasive line/device sites, and any draining sites (eyes, ears). The current provincial guidelines recommend only nares and wound swabs. As such there was a wider range of samples per patient from the 6 months in 2005 compared to 2006. The TAT in 2005 ranged from 3 to 6 days whereas the TAT in 2006 ranged from 1&#x02013;2 days. The average workload was greater in 2005 because confirmation of the MRSA by latex agglutination or PCR was required whereas this is not necessary with the MRSASelect&#x02122;.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The TAT for all specimen types was 1&#x02013;4 days shorter using the MRSASelect&#x02122; medium compared to MSA-Ox. The Infection Control Dept strongly endorsed the use of the chromogenic medium for MRSA ward screens as it significantly improved (ie, reduced) the time-frame need for them to determine if isolation precautions were needed or not. In addition the workflow on the bench was significantly improved and the workload greatly reduced.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Our lab has used PCR for the screening of Methicillin Resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) for the past two years. We wanted to find a method with equal sensitivity and better turn around time (TAT). This is why we compared direct inoculation on Oxoid Denim Blue chromogenic agar (ODB) with selective broth inoculation followed by Roche PCR Lightcycler <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (PCR).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>500 consecutive clinical samples were tested by ODB (Oxoid, MP1571) and PCR (ref: 03376419001). Samples were first inoculated directly on to ODB then into Staph broth (Oxoid: MT1961) then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 18&#x02013;24hrs. Once incubated, an aliquot of the broth was extracted and tested by PCR as per manufacturer's instructions. PCR (+) samples were subcultured onto ODB and incubated for 18&#x02013;24 hours. Suspect colonies on ODB were identified as MRSA (catalase, coagulase, latex agglutination-DENKA: ref: 230782, growth on Mueller Hinton salt with oxacillin agar).</p>

        <p>In our laboratory PCR is more sensitive than ODB at the cost of longer TAT. We favour PCR to ODB as screening method for MRSA. PCR is best suited for hospitals with low rates of MRSA due to its high sensitivity.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>In June 2005, MRSA was declared a &#x0201c;pathogen under surveillance&#x0201d; to determine the epidemiology of MRSA in AB. Laboratory (Lab) surveillance using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of first clinical isolates belonging to new hospital-associated (HA-) and community-associated (CA-) MRSA cases was initiated.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>The 1st clinical isolate, not &#x0201c;screening&#x0201d; isolate, of a new MRSA case (ie, no previous record of having MRSA in the past 12 months) was submitted by regional labs to ProvLab. Data on cases included: age, gender, region, in-/out-patient status, date of collection, specimen source, specimen type. PFGE and PCR to detect presence of Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) gene and Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome (SCC), were done. PFGE profiles were defined as related to one of the prototype strains (CMRSA1 to CMRSA10) using national Canadian nomenclature.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Of 3,000 isolates typed, 43% and 7% are CMRSA10 and CMRSA7 (CA-MRSA strains) respectively, and 36% are CMRSA2 (HA-MRSA strains). The average monthly submissions between 1st and 2nd year is rising (143 to 218), especially for CMRSA10. SCC type IV /PVL was found in 98%/73% and 3%/26% of CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA strains, respectively. Most common clinical source was skin and soft tissues (93%, CA-MRSA; 54%, HA-MRSA).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>In AB, infections due to CA-MRSA are becoming more common than HA-MRSA, with CMRSA10 emerging as the most common strain province-wide.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>We used the real time Artus Influenza RT-PCR kit (cat: 4505005)(PCR) as first line assay for Influenza testing during the 2005&#x02013;6 Influenza season. We hypothesized that PCR would show sensitivity and specificity similar to those obtained against a panel of samples with known results (sens: 98%, spec: 98%, PPV: 98%, NPV: 98%; Cacmid 2006, J2). We also hypothesized that most PCR(+) would be confirmed by viral culture (VC) or Nasba.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Diagnostic samples (Dx) were tested by PCR and VC. Surveillance samples (Sv) were tested by PCR only. Any PCR(+) was confirmed by VC. PCR(+)/VC(&#x02212;) samples were tested by Nasba. We audited PCR results for March and April 2006. PCR(+) were considered true positive/confirmed if VC(+) or Nasba(+).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>661 samples were tested. PCR was positive for 294 samples and equivocal for 33 samples. All equivocal samples were VC(&#x02212;) and only 3 were Nasba(+). Of the 294 PCR(+) samples, 245 were confirmed by VC and 31 by Nasba. PCR performances were calculated for the 201 Dx samples. We had no false(&#x02212;) PCR in the Dx subgroup. Results are given below: 94% of PCR(+) samples were confirmed by VC or Nasba. VC confirmed only 88% of true(+) PCR. PCR(+) samples with a crossing point (CP) of 20 to 33,99 and curve amplitude (CA) equal or greater than 0.6 were always confirmed by VC or Nasba. These criteria exclude all false (+) PCR. 90% of all confirmed PCR fell within these values. Samples with CP equal or greater than 38 were all false (+) PCR.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Artus Influenza RT-PCR is as sensitive and specific in clinical use as it is in a controlled study. Using a set of criteria based on CP and CA values, the number of PCR(+) samples needing confirmation can be reduced to a minimum. PCR is more sensitive than VC in our laboratory.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>The study objectives were: 1) To develop and validate a real-time PCR method for human metapneumovirus (hMPV) diagnosis. 2) To determine the prevalence of hMPV in the community and its association with outbreaks. 3) To provide epidemiological data in terms of age distribution, seasonality and co-infections for hMPV.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODOLOGY</title>
        <p>A real-time PCR assay was designed for amplification and detection of hMPV lineages A and B based on the fusion (F) gene. Hydrolysis (TaqMan) probes were designed for detection of all hMPV and to differentiate between lineage A and B viruses. Amplification and detection of hMPV was undertaken using an ABI 7500 SDS. Target sequences were cloned and in vitro expression used to generate lineage A and B synthetic RNA for limit of detection (LOD) studies by probit analysis (SPSS). Nucleic acid was extracted from respiratory specimens using the easyMAG&#x000ae; extractor (bioM&#x000e9;rieux). Prospective testing for hMPV over a 2 year period was then undertaken. Cycle sequencing procedures were utilised for sub-lineage determination of representative positive samples.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The PCR was sensitive and specific for detection of hMPV with a LOD of &#x0003c;100 copies for each virus lineage. The virus was detected in 9.4% (n = 8239) of the specimens analyzed from January 2005-March 2006. hMPV positive results were obtained for all age groups (18 days to 99 years) with the positive rate significantly higher in the younger age groups as compared to those &#x0003e;2 years of age (Chi-squared test; p&#x0003c;0.001). Co-infections were identified frequently with 16.3% of hMPV positive samples having at least one other detectable virus reported. hMPV was found associated with 25% of respiratory outbreaks during the 2005/2006 respiratory season (either as the only identified pathogen or as a co-infection) with 8 of the hMPV positive outbreaks in schools and 17 in long term and assisted care centres. The number of positive samples peaked during December, January and February 2005/2006 showing distinct seasonality for this virus. hMPV positive samples analyzed by sequencing were sub-lineage A2 or B2.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>hMPV is common in the community, affects all age groups and is associated with outbreaks. Including hMPV in routine testing improves etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory infections and outbreaks.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>While Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) type 1 and 2 were identified long before other viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 and 2, serological assays that have undergone scientific validation for HSV have only recently been made widely available. Published evidence based guidelines emphasize that appropriate management of genital herpes (GH) requires knowing whether infection is due to HSV-1 or 2. Our research aim was to 1) evaluate the scientific and clinical evidence of HSV type specific serology (TSS) assays and 2) to assess the impact of providing HSV TSS through a Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (PLPH).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Review and critical appraisal of the scientific, medical and commercial literature regarding HSV serology, in particular type specific serology, was performed. An HSV-2 TSS assay was selected and implemented on September 19, 2005 through one PLPH. An algorithm was developed wherein HSV serology testing was performed only when specific clinical criteria, based on evidence based guidelines, were met. Physician satisfaction, testing volumes and the financial impact was closely monitored over one year.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Published data supports that HSV-1 and -2 glycoprotein G (gG) based serology assays provide the best sensitivity and specificity to differentiate HSV-1 and 2 compared to the gold standard, the University of Washington western blot. The Focus Herpeselect&#x000ae; 2 assay platform, based on HSV gG, was implemented. Over 12 months, physician satisfaction remained high and HSV-TSS testing volumes were not significantly different when compared to previous years&#x02019; HSV non-TSS testing volumes.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Though HSV-TSS is not first-line testing for GH, there exist well-established evidence based guidelines for its use in specific circumstances. Only HSV gG based serology assays have been shown to reliably differentiate between HSV-1 and 2, though a number of manufacturers market non-gG based assays as &#x02018;type specific&#x02019;. This study was the first to offer through a Provincial reference laboratory HSV gG based TSS testing, with a process ensuring that patients meet specific clinical criteria before performing the test. The physician community, especially infectious disease and STD specialists, welcomed this. After one year, this new testing algorithm proved cost-neutral.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To evaluate the performance of the new ID-Tag&#x02122; RVP test for the detection of respiratory viruses.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>227 NP specimens were collected from symptomatic patients and were tested by the ID-Tag&#x02122; RVP test (TM Bioscience Corporation, Canada) and conventional DFA plus culture. The RVP test is a new test that detects 20 respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR, a Universal Array of oligonucleotides (TM Bioscience), and a fluidic microbead array (Luminex X-Map). DFA and culture were performed using commercial Mcabs and R-Mix shell vials. The ID-Tag&#x02122; RVP test was performed according to manufacturer's instructions and involved a multiplex PCR followed a multiplex Target Specific Primer Extension (TSPE) reaction and sorting of TSPE products using the Luminex X-Map system. Discordants were resolved with a second PCR.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Twenty-one specimens failed to give a signal for the internal control indicating extraction failure and were eliminated from the analysis. Of the 206 specimens analysed, 135 were positive by both RVP and DFA/culture and 37 were negative by both tests. There were 7 RVP-DFA/culture+ and 27 RVP+ DFA/culture&#x02013; discordant results. After resolution of discordants by a second PCR, RVP had a sensitivity of 95.8% (138/144) compared with 93.7% (135/144) for DFA/culture. RVP detected an additional 26 confirmed positives including</p>
        <p>22 Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, 1 NL63 and 3 HKU1 Coronavirus not tested for by DFA or culture and 4 additional Influenza B positives that were missed by DFA/culture.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>The ID-Tag&#x02122; RVP test is more sensitive than DFA plus culture and detects an additional 12 respiratory viruses not tested for by DFA and culture. The ID-Tag&#x02122; RVP test should improve the ability of hospital and public health laboratories to diagnose viral respiratory tract infections in a hospital or community outbreak situation.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) are associated with particularly high case fatality rates (80&#x02013;90%) and have recently gained notoriety as potential agents of bioterrorism, there are currently no vaccines or treatments licensed for human use. We describe the development of vaccines capable of protecting relevant animal models from challenge with either Zaire Ebola virus or Marburg virus.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>We developed vaccine candidates for EBOV, and MARV based on live attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectors expressing the relevant glycoproteins. Single intramuscular injections of each vaccine were administered to na&#x000ef;ve non-human primates (n=4 per vaccine), 28 days later the animals were challenged with at least 1000 plaque forming units of virulent EBOV or MARV. Single dose, oral and intranasal immunization of mice and guinea pigs and nonhuman primates were also tested for protective effect. Finally we tested the ability of the VSV Ebola and VSV Marburg vaccine to protect animals when administered as a post-exposure vaccine at 30 min to 24 hours after infection with the virulent agent.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>None of the animals developed fever or other symptoms of illness following vaccination. Immunization elicited protective immune responses in all of the non-human primates against otherwise lethal challenges. The EBOV vaccine induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in all vaccinated monkeys, while the MARV vaccine predominately induced a humoral response. Mucosal imminzation resulted in protection of rodents from challenge with up to 1 Million LD<sub>50</sub> and Nonhuman primates from 1000 LD<sub>50</sub>. All of the nonhuman infected with Marburg virus and 50% of the nonhuman primates infected with Ebola survived when treated 30 minutes post-exposure.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Our data suggest that these vaccine candidates are safe and highly efficacious in highly relevant animal models. Furthermore, there is an unprecedented potential for use as a post-exposure vaccine.</p>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p>Improving the detection and characterization of Influenza A is important for both routine influenza diagnostics and pandemic preparedness. A number of in-house and commercial assays are being used in clinical microbiology laboratories nationally. No formal evaluation to compare the sensitivity and specificity of these assays has been undertaken to date.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To compare the sensitivity and specificity of commercial and in-house nucleic acid amplification assays currently in use at 11 participating laboratories across Canada for the detection of Influenza RNA.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Panels composed of 44 extracted RNA samples were generated from 4 ten-fold dilutions each of cultured H1, H3 and H5 viral lysate (replicates of three, total of 36 samples) and one sample each of Influenza H9, Influenza B, RSV, human Metapneumovirus, and Enterovirus, plus 3 negative water samples. RNA samples were randomized by a third party, dispensed in 20 &#x003bc;L amounts, frozen and sent to 11 participating laboratories. The assays used for testing included in-house assays using published or in-house designed primers/probes; the CDC recommended protocol, the NML recommended protocol and an Influenza A NASBA assay. Commercial assays used included the RealArt<sup>TM</sup> Influenza RT-PCR from artus (Qiagen), the Prodesse ProFlu-1 and the Influenza A RT-PCR from Cepheid. Most assays detected Influenza A only, but some were also capable of detecting Influenza B and/or RSV. Two laboratories chose to also test the panel with haemagglutinin-specific assays capable of typing the virus as H1, H3 or H5. Three additional sites were able to specifically identify H5 with their particular assay.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Positivity of the diluted positive H1, H3 and H5 RNA samples ranged from 25/36 (69.4%) to 36/36 (100%) with some commercial and in-house assays able to specifically detect not only the positive samples at the higher concentrations, but also those at the low concentrations which were missed by the other assays. Assays specifically designed to type the haemagglutinin protein of the Influenza A virus were specific but did not appear to be as sensitive as the consensus Influenza A assays.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>There has been a perceived loss of effectiveness of antimicrobial restrictions in our health region. A two week, prospective audit was done to assess utilization patterns of CH's five highest use broad spectrum and/or restricted antimicrobials in medical, surgical, and critical care settings at 4 hospitals.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Patients were identified by Pharmacy computer systems when newly started on any of five targeted antimicrobials: ciprofloxacin IV, clindamycin IV, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin IV. Data collected included admitting service, diagnosis, culture results and other laboratory parameters, concomitant antimicrobial therapy, and outcome at the end of the audit. The assessment of adherence to published regional guidelines was evaluated by two independent reviewers (ID physician and Antimicrobial Utilization pharmacists). In discordant cases, resolution was by committee.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>80 patients received 93 treatment courses (use events) of a targeted antimicrobial from medical and general surgical wards and a single intensive care unit. The distribution of use events was 52.7% Surgical, 30.1% Critical Care, and 17.2% Medicine. The median age was 61 years, with 40% male and 60% female patients. Clindamycin and imipenem use were minimal at 6% and 2% respectively, the other data are below. In only one instance was a Restricted Antimicrobial Form filled out.</p>

        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Ciprofloxacin IV use was high, including inappropriate surgical prophylaxis. Utilization of other agents was generally adherent to guidelines. There was evidence of unnecessary antimicrobial use, and inappropriate spectrum use which could impact patient outcomes. The restriction system is ineffective and the process needs to be reevaluated to both educate clinicians and address changes in health care delivery at our institutions.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>
          <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> is the most common cause of nosocomial infectious diarrhea. In the context of the recent epidemic in Quebec, the Laboratoire de sant&#x000e9; publique du Qu&#x000e9;bec (LSPQ) organized a quality control program to monitor, evaluate and document the performance of <italic>C difficile</italic> diagnostic testing by microbiology laboratories. METHOD: Two panels of three simulated stool specimens were sent to 72 hospital and private laboratories in Quebec, one in May 2005, another one in June 2006. Strains of <italic>C difficile</italic> were chosen on the basis of toxin A and toxin B production and concentration.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Sixty laboratories (83 %) had specific pre-analytic criteria for testing. Thirty-three of them (46 %) used a cell culture assay for the detection of toxin B (gold standard), 15 used a commercial kit detecting toxin A only, 20 used a commercial kit detecting both toxins A and B. Nineteen laboratories used a combination of two different testing methods. The nine commercial kits could detect toxin A and only five of them detected toxin B. The Triage&#x000ae; Micro <italic>C difficile</italic> Panel (EIA) was used by 24 participants. All of the 72 participants correctly reported the negative specimens and the ones containing high titres of toxin A; 97% correctly reported specimens with lower titres of toxin A and 88 % correctly reported the specimen containing a toxin A negative /toxin B positive strain. The cytotoxin assay was 100% sensitive and specific. The Triage&#x000ae; was the most sensitive commercial assay, but lacked specificity; it was however a useful screening tool in the management of the current epidemic. Laboratory reporting schemes were provided by the 72 laboratories, and 63 of them were deemed appropriate and acceptable.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Overall, the results of the proficiency testing program were satisfactory. Laboratories were reminded that toxin A testing only may result in false negative reports (ie, toxin A negative /toxin B positive isolates). For laboratories using commercial kits, a system devised for the detection of toxin A and B is a necessary complement to other screening methods.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Proficiency testing (PT) and quality control (QC) monitoring both involve testing of an external analyte. While PT is meant to measure the overall process of how a lab tests and reports results, QC monitoring is more specific and is directed at ensuring that a specific test is performing correctly. Canadian HIV testing labs generally use a common HIV screen test, although not all use a common QC external control. Here we present results over 2 years in which a &#x02018;real-time&#x02019; QC Internet software package was provided with a common set of external QC reagents to Canadian labs performing HIV screen testing. In less than one year, significant performance problems were identified in the Abbott AXSym HIV-1 gO EIA test.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Two different commercial HIV-1 external reagents, Pelispys (VQC, Netherlands) and an Accurun (Boston Biomedica) were provided to Canadian labs using the Abbott AXSym HIV gO EIA screen test. An Internet-based program, EDCNet, designed by the Australian National HIV Serology Lab was also distributed. Labs entered their test results on the controls into EDCNet which analysed lab performance in &#x02018;real-time&#x02019;. The NLHRS monitored the performance of all Canadian labs entered into the program.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Labs were available to receive graphical reports in &#x02018;real-time&#x02019; providing information on their performance on the ext QC. This data was presented in the form of Levy-Jennings or Shewart plots. In November, 2005, testing patterns on the external QC reagents revealed very high values outside of 2-standard deviations (SD) and in violation of common QC rules. This pattern was instantly noticed in several lots of the EIA kits and in different labs across Canada.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Identification of performance problems in the Abbott AXSym HIV gO EIA led to a concerted discussion amongst Canadian HIV labs. The outcome of these discussions was discussed with the manufacturer and an internal investigation identified a defect in one of the components used in the EIA kits. This has since led to a change in manufacturing protocol by Abbott. The ability to provide and monitor HIV kit performance in &#x02018;real-time&#x02019; using EDCNet and a common set of external QC reagents provides a powerful means to instantly monitor HIV kit performance on a national scale.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Proficiency testing (PT) provides a method of comparing an individual lab's performance with other labs. The NLHRS traditionally received PT test results via fax/mail with subsequent actions being conducted manually. This included data entry and analysis and communication of performance back to participants by email, fax and mail. This method was time-consuming, inefficient and led to greater-than-acceptable delays in the delivery of important information related to lab performance. Here we present results from a pilot project in which NLHRS used an online informatics platform (DigitalPT) to manage the entire PT process, from online registration of participants, to online submission of test results, to results evaluation to communication of performance via email and online access</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>This pilot included 89 participants in our HIV Serology and HIV-1 Viral Load programs for a single test event. Three on-line training sessions were conducted in advance of panel shipments for both programs. A 2 week window was provided for submission of results on-line. Data analysis was performed automatically using a Results Evaluation Process (REP) engine configured to our evaluating criteria.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Approximately 1/3 of total labs participated in the on-line training session. Customer support was provided primarily to participants that did not take part in the advance training sessions and cantered on two issues: (1) usernames and password and (2) adding new assays to the system. Technical difficulties were associated more with participants enrolled in the HIV serology program with approximately 60% of labs entering partial or complete data. A higher rate (80%) of data entry success was observed for participants enrolled in the HIV viral load program. Approximately 25 labs did not submit any data. Statistical analysis was performed quickly with a preliminary analysis being obtained within 1 day of the submission deadline.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The nature of technical difficulties experienced by users is typical of a new system and should significantly diminish over subsequent test events. It also illustrated the value of advance training. Furthermore, the rapid turnaround of data analysis for review by the NLHRS results in a much more rapid turn-around-time for release of final reports to labs allowing them to take corrective actions sooner.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>During a survey for Class A ESBL, a cluster of ciprofloxacin-intermediate, cephalosporin-resistant (<italic>bla</italic>-R) <italic>K</italic> pneumoniae with an inducible Class C &#x003b2;-lactamase (indC) phenotype was identified. Screening found new patients co-colonized with indC <italic>E coli</italic>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Laboratory records were reviewed back to 2001 for indC strains. <italic>K pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E coli</italic> from clinical specimens and rectal swabs cultured to MacConkey with 2mg/L cefpodoxime were identified by Vitek. Prediction of <italic>bla</italic>-R genotype was by Modified Disk Diffusion Test with cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and aztreonam placed 15mm from clavulanate and cefoxitin disks, with observation for blunted D-zones typical of indC. All indC strains were typed by <italic>Xba</italic>I PFGE and select strains sequenced for <italic>bla</italic>-R genes.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>From Jan-Aug 2006, 23 patients were identified with indC <italic>K pneumoniae</italic>, 15 with indC <italic>E coli</italic> and 11 with both. Of the total 27 patients, 2 were bacteremic and the rest colonized. Review and PFGE found 1 patient (Pat-A) to have carried the same indC <italic>K pneumoniae</italic> and indC <italic>E coli</italic> intermittently from 2002 to 2006, and that this patients&#x02019; 2002 roommate had been colonized with the same two strains from 2001 to 2003. In 2006, Pat-A also carried the second indC <italic>K pneumoniae</italic> strain that predominated in the outbreak, as it was found in 14/23 (60.9%) 2006 cases with indC klebsiella. PFGE showed the original <italic>E coli</italic> from Pat-A to be present in 2/14 (14.3%) patients with indC <italic>E coli</italic> in 2006. A further 7 cases had distinct <italic>K pneumoniae</italic> and 11 cases had distinct <italic>E coli</italic> with the ind-C phenotype. PCR and sequencing confirmed <italic>bla</italic>-DHA-1 to be present in the <italic>K pneumoniae</italic> from 2001and in the 6 <italic>K pneumoniae</italic> and the 2 <italic>E coli</italic> from 2006 that were tested. PCR found <italic>orf513</italic> absent in these isolates, suggesting that the <italic>bla</italic>-DHA-1 determinants may be distinct from those previously described.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Both the indC <italic>K pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E coli</italic> were persistent colonizers (&#x0003e;4 yrs) in one patient resulting in transmission of the plasmid into multiple strains and a bacteremic infection in 2006. The <italic>bla</italic>DHA-1 likely transferred in vivo from the initial <italic>K pneumoniae</italic> or <italic>E coli</italic> to multiple other unrelated <italic>K pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E coli</italic> strains. To our knowledge, this is the first poly-clonal DHA-1 outbreak to be reported outside of Korea, Taiwan and Paris.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>In spite of the increasing incidence of ESBL-PE, limited data exists on risk factors associated with their acquisition or optimal measures for preventing their spread. Furthermore, most data comes from outbreak settings and from single healthcare facilities. This study provides data on the regional epidemiology of ESBL-PE, and compared individuals with community vs hospital-acquired ESBL.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Since 2002 all laboratories within our region, which has a population of 850 000, 5 acute and 25 non-acute care facilities, forwarded clinical isolates harboring an ESBL to a single laboratory. A chart review was performed to collect demographic and risk factor data on all patients with a confirmed ESBL-PE from January 2002 to April 2005.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>119 patients had a clinical specimen with an ESBL-PE; 96 were identified through hospital or long-term care based facilities, 23 through outpatient clinics. 108 charts were available for further review. Of these, 78 cases were likely health-care associated and 30 community-acquired, with the proportion of the latter increasing from 19% in 2002 to 33% in 2004. No healthcare facility outbreaks were noted during this period. 68.5% of isolates were <italic>E coli</italic>, 31.5% <italic>Klebsiella</italic> species. Isolates were recovered from urine in 72.2%, blood 12%, wound 10.2%, sputum 6.5, stool 2.8% and other sites 4.6%. Most patients were female. The average age was 54.2 years. 51% were inpatients at the time of detection. 35% had a prior admission to hospital and 75% antibiotic exposure within a year of ESBL isolation. 63% had an invasive procedure in the preceding 6 months. Compared to health care-associated cases, community cases were predominantly female (OR=3.6, CI 1.33&#x02013;9.80), younger (47.4 vs 58.5 years) and less likely to have prior, recent antibiotic exposure (OR=0.18, CI 0.07&#x02013;0.49). Community isolates were more likely to be <italic>E coli</italic> (OR=9.7, CI 2.2&#x02013;43.8) and obtained from urine (OR=7.8, CI 1.7&#x02013;35.4).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The regional incidence of ESBL-PE is increasing in the absence of nosocomial outbreaks. Although most patients with ESBL-PE had traditional risk factors, we identified a subset of apparently healthy individuals from the community. This is one of few studies providing comprehensive regional ESBL data and describing the role of community acquisition.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Various studies have shown chromogenic media to have better detection rates of yeast in mixed cultures than conventional methods, while also providing a more direct and rapid identification of specific <italic>Candida</italic> species. This study evaluated four chromogenic yeast agars (CandiSelect [CSBR], CHROMagar Candida from two suppliers [CABD and CADL], and chromogenic Candida agar [OCCA]) in comparison to the current method used in our laboratory (phytone media with germ tube, PGT) for the isolation and identification of <italic>Candida</italic> species.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Vaginal specimens were chosen to be planted to each of the four test media. Specimens had originally been inoculated to phytone medium, with a germ tube performed for all yeast isolates. Specimens were chosen as follows: (a) predominant yeast isolated, both <italic>C albicans</italic> and <italic>Candida</italic> other than <italic>C albicans</italic>, (ii) yeast mixed with large amounts of bacterial genital flora, (iii) mixed yeast, and (iv) genital bacterial flora only. All chromogenic media also identified <italic>C tropicalis</italic> and <italic>C krusei</italic>, but only CSBR identified <italic>C glabrata</italic>. Half-plates of each chromogenic agar were used for each specimen, and plates were examined at 24 and 48 hours. Yeast isolates which produced discrepant results (both amongst the chro-mogenic media and with PGT) were also identified by the VITEK automated system. In addition, technologists rated ease of use of each medium.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A total of 116 specimens were examined, of which 60 were known <italic>C albicans</italic>. The rates of isolation and identification of <italic>C albicans</italic> for PGT, CSBR, CABD, CADL, and OCCA were 45%, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 92%, respectively. Thirty-three germ tube-negative specimens were identified as <italic>C albicans</italic> by all of the chromogenic media. Mixed yeast specimens had variable results with each medium. Technologists found that, in general, colour differentiation was good on all chromogenic media at 48 hours. However, species differentiation was more difficult with CSBR and OCCA.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>All of the chromogenic media were found to be superior to phytone plus germ tube for identification of <italic>C albicans</italic>. In addition, chromogenic media identified other <italic>Candida</italic> species, and was generally easy to use. CABD has been incorporated into our genital specimen work-up, and further evaluation will be done for other specimen types.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Urine specimens constitute the highest volume of tests done that contribute significantly to the daily work load in a clinical Microbiology laboratory. Urine culture is traditionally done by inoculating 0.001ml onto Blood and MacConkey agar (BA/MAC split plate). CHROMagar&#x02122; Orientation medium for urine culture offers presumptive identification of the organisms by means of distinct colony colors. The objectives of this pilot study were (a) to assess the ability of chromogenic medium to correctly identify common uropathogens with only a minimum of confirmatory tests and (b) to assess the time and cost saving by using the chromogenic agar as a primary medium.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Consecutive urine samples (194) were inoculated simultaneously on the BA/MAC split plate (manual inoculation and streaking) and the CHROMagar&#x02122; (Isoplater automated streaking). Plates were read after overnight incubation. The two different media were read independently by two different technologists.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>There was complete correlation for 150/194 (77%) samples.</p>
        <p>(No growth on 60 samples, clinically significant organisms on 47 samples and mixed growth on 43 samples). There was total correlation with colony counts of all uropathogens on both plates. Colour reactions of the colonies on CHROMagar&#x02122; correlated well with the final identification of the organism; <italic>E coli</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus spp</italic> were recognized easily. The remaining 44 samples were discordant (eg, growing on one or the other media). The discordant results were with organisms in low numbers that were not clinically significant.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>This pilot study indicated that CHROMagar&#x02122; is as good as the BA/MAC split plate for growing and detecting uropathogens. It also inhibited the growth of many normal flora organisms and hence reduced unnecessary work up. CHROMagar&#x02122; plates can be streaked by the Isoplater thereby providing a cost saving in terms of tech time and labour.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>High numbers of cases of a community-associated MRSA strain, CMRSA10 (USA300) that was first investigated and reported as an outbreak in 2004, continue to occur in the Calgary Health Region (CHR). When follow-up of CMRSA10 cases was discontinued provincially, public health officials in the CHR continued to carry out case follow-up, using an enhanced surveillance questionnaire to identify and monitor possible risk factors for exposure, and to develop and implement public health MRSA prevention and control measures.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>An enhanced surveillance questionnaire was developed based on known risk factors for CMRSA10 infection: history of homelessness, incarceration and/or illicit drug use; participation in sports activities; use of personal services and other factors identified in the literature. Cases of CMRSA10 identified through routine strain typing of MRSA clinical isolates (carried out by the Provincial Laboratory for Public Health) were contacted and administered the questionnaire, with direct data entry into a Microsoft Access 2000 database. Analysis of the data is pending.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The mean number of cases per month of CMRSA10 was 51 (range 29 to 71) over the period from April through October 2006. The majority of cases continued to have one or more of the risk factors initially identified in the 2004 outbreak investigation: homelessness, incarceration or illicit drug use. Specific results are anticipated, pending a more detailed analysis of data collected from July through December 2006.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>CMRSA10 incidence is increasing in the CHR and public health surveillance is necessary to monitor risk factors in order to develop appropriately-targeted interventions including general hygiene recommendations.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The CMRSA-7 (USA400) and CMRSA-10 (USA300) strains of MRSA are associated with &#x0201c;community-acquisition&#x0201d;. We report the clinical and epidemiologic features of patients with these MRSA strain types seen at our hospital over a 21 month period.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>MRSA isolates were genotyped by PFGE. The medical records of patients with positive cultures for CMRSA-7 or CMRSA-10 strain types from Jan/05-Sept/06 were reviewed. SCC<italic>mec</italic> typing and the presence of PVL were determined by PCR.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The available records of 52/57 patients were reviewed. CMRSA-10 was present in 47 patients and CMRSA-7 in 5. The mean age was 48.7 yrs (range 18&#x02013;90 yrs). The male/female ratio was 34:18. MRSA was community associated (CA) in 37 patients, health care associated in 9 and nosocomial in 6. Substance abuse was the most frequent risk factor for being CA (15/37 or 32%); 9 of these 15 (60%) were IVDU. 5/37 CA-MRSA had a history of incarceration and 4 had a history of being homeless. Of the 6 nosocomial MRSA, 5 occurred at one campus of our hospital and the index case had not been screened on admission. Colonization was present in 16/52 (31%) patients while infection was present in 36 (69%). Soft tissue infection was the most frequent presentation (24 patients); all received ineffective empiric therapy but there were no deaths. Bacteremia occurred in 5 patients with 3 deaths; 1 directly attributable to the bacteremia, 2 associated with withdrawl of therapy. Pneumonia occurred in 3 patients and all died; 1 directly attributed to infection, 2 associated with withdrawl of therapy. Other types of infections occurred in the other 4 patients and all responded to effective therapy. Only one patient with MRSA infection was known to be colonized with MRSA prior to the development of the infection. Of the 21 isolates that have been tested thus far, 18 carried PVL. SCC<italic>mec</italic> type IVa was present in 18 and type II in 3 isolates.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The risk factors and clinical presentation of patients with CMRSA-7 or CMRSA-10 seen at our hospital were similar to other published reports. However, not all are CA and there was nosocomial transmission. Admission screening criteria for MRSA needs to be expanded and empiric therapy for staphylococcal infections in high risk patients may need to be altered to deal with the changing epidemiology of MRSA in our region.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>MRSA are largely derived from 5 major ancestral lineages. Typing of strains according to the SCC<italic>mec</italic> &#x0201c;junkyard&#x0201d; region is essential to elucidating their epidemiology. This blinded study compared two multiplex PCR assays designed to type this region, using isolates that had been submitted to the Mount Sinai Hospital Microbiology Laboratory by Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network (CBSN) participants between 2002 and 2005.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Using 240 MRSA, well-characterized for <italic>mec</italic>, <italic>nuc</italic> and <italic>pvl</italic>, the combined reference protocols (Ref-PCR) of Oliveira AAC 2002;46:2155 (SCC<italic>mec</italic> I-III) and Ma AAC 2002;46:1147 (SCC<italic>mec</italic> IVa-b) and GenBank derived primers for SCC<italic>mec</italic> IVc-d were compared to the novel multiplex (Nov-PCR) of Zhang JCM 2005; 43:5026 (SCC<italic>mec</italic> I-V).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>For 179 of 240 MRSA examined, Ref-PCR identified 167 cassettes as type II and 12 as type II-variants, while the Nov-PCR identified 162 cassettes as type II, 13 as type I &#x00026; II, 1 as type I &#x00026; IVc, and 3 were non-typeable (NT) by this method. Both methods typed 16 of 240 MRSA as III, although Ref-PCR designated one a type III-variant. Both methods also agreed on the cassette type in all 22 <italic>pvl</italic>-positive and the 6 <italic>pvl</italic>-negative isolates with type IVa cassettes. However, for 23 other <italic>pvl</italic>-negative MRSA strains with type IV cassettes, the Ref-PCR method identified 3 to have type IVb cassettes, 6 to have type IVc cassettes, 4 to have type IVd cassettes, and 4 to have type IV cassettes other than a-d. For these same isolates, the Nov-PCR method identified 4 to have type IVb cassettes and 3 to have type IVd cassettes, but 12 were not able to be typed by this method. The 13 MRSA that were identified to have SCC<italic>mec</italic> type I &#x00026; II by Nov-PCR were from Ontario in 2002 where a single epidemic clone (CMRSA-1; USA 600; ST45) had been prevalent; all 13 strains were positive for the type I associated <italic>pls</italic> gene, indicating the presence of a type II cassette with a portion of the &#x0201c;right extremity&#x0201d; of the type I cassette.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Both methods generally agreed for the most commonly isolated MRSA (SCC<italic>mec</italic> II, III and IVa). However, Nov-PCR failed to yield products for the less common II-variant, IVc and IV not a-d cassettes. This demonstrates that no single assay identifies all SCC<italic>mec</italic> types in current circulation nor adequately resolves the IV or variant cassettes. Current methods should be refined given the constant evolution of the SCC<italic>mec</italic> element.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Community-Associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) has been reported as an emerging pathogen in Vancouver; however, little is known regarding its evolving role as an etiologic agent at our institution. We undertook prospective surveillance of all MRSA isolates over a 3 month period to determine whether CA-MRSA was present, and to correlate CA-MRSA with reported antibiotic susceptibility profiles and clinical presentation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>MRSA isolates from clinical specimens were tracked from January to April 2006. Only one isolate per patient was included in the review. Clinical specimens from sterile sites were given preference over non-sterile sites if multiple specimens were available. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles, patient location at time of specimen collection and demographic data were collected. Molecular analysis was performed on all isolates. The presence of CA-MRSA markers, namely SCC<italic>mec</italic>IV, PVL and PFGE type was evaluated.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>374 isolates were identified. 50% were from wounds, 30% from screening cultures and 5.6% were from invasive specimens. Overall, 33% of specimens were collected from ER locations. 61% of all isolates were PVL positive. PVL positive isolates were more likely recovered from wound specimens (80%), and specifically from ER wounds &#x02013; 96% were PVL positive. However, non-ER specimens accounted for 53% of PVL positive isolates. PVL positive isolates were more likely to be clindamycin susceptible (64%) than PVL negative isolates (8%) and more likely to be SXT susceptible (98% vs. 28%). Clindamycin susceptibility is lower in 2006 compared to isolates tested in 2005 (79% sensitive). PVL positive isolates were found to be CMRSA10 (USA300) by PFGE, and SCC<italic>mec</italic>IV positive.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>CA-MRSA belonging to a single clonal group (CMR-SA10) is well established in Vancouver. CA-MRSA is predominant in skin and soft tissue isolates collected in the ER setting, suggestive of ongoing community spread and disease burden. The emergence of CA-MRSA may need to be addressed in hospital isolation policies. Isolates remain susceptible to non-B-lactam antibiotics, however clindamycin susceptibility may be decreasing.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>A sensitive and specific real-time Taqman assay has been used at Provincial Laboratory in Alberta since March 2004 to screen for norovirus in suspected viral gastroenteritis (GI) outbreaks. The objective of this study is to look for other common enteric viruses in suspected viral GI outbreaks that tested negative for norovirus with sensitive real-time molecular assays.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Nuclei acid extracts and cDNA synthesized from selected specimens from non-norovirus GI outbreaks were tested using three in-house real time Taqman assays developed and validated for rotavirus, enteric adenovirus (40,41) and astrovirus.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>From 2004 to 2005, 491 GI outbreaks investigations were initiated through the Epidemiological Investigation (EI) process at ProvLab. Public health investigators listed norovirus as the suspected etio-logical agent for 399 (81%) of all the GI outbreaks. Sixty-seven of those 399 suspected norovirus outbreaks had no stool specimens submitted for laboratory testing, and 254 of the remaining 332 outbreaks (76.5%) were confirmed to be caused by norovirus. Forty outbreaks that had no specified suspected agent also had norovirus screening and 13 of those 40 outbreaks (33%) tested positive for norovirus. Norovirus was also found in one outbreak that was originally thought to have a bacterial cause and two outbreaks that was thought to be from food poisoning. At the end, the etiological agents of 65 suspected norovirus outbreaks and 12 outbreaks with no suspected agent from 2004&#x02013;2005 remained unresolved. With the enhanced enteric virus testing, an etiological agent was identified in 13 of the 64 unresolved suspected-norovirus outbreaks (20.3%) with rotavirus found in 11 outbreaks (nine in long term care facilities and two in other types of community facilities) and enteric adenovirus in 2 outbreaks (one in a long term care facility and one in a childcare setting). Testing was performed on 8 of the 12 outbreaks that had no suspected agent and no enteric virus was found.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The importance of enteric viruses other than norovirus as etiological agents for GI outbreaks was better recognized with the use of sensitive real time molecular assays.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Norovirus is the most commonly identified cause of gas-troenteritis outbreaks in Alberta. The molecular epidemiology of circulating norovirus strains was analyzed over a two-year period in terms of outbreak settings and seasonal trend.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Stool samples from suspected norovirus outbreaks were tested using an in-house multiplex real time Taqman RT-PCR assay except for Jan and Feb 2004 when a conventional RT-PCR method was used. At least one RT-PCR positive specimen from each confirmed norovirus outbreak was selected for sequencing. The cDNA synthesized from selected specimens was amplified with primers from region C (capsid) and D (capsid) for GII and region D for GI. If the amplification failed in region C and D for a sample, amplification was performed from region B (polymerase) for both GI and GII. The amplicons were sequenced and the phylogenetic relatedness to reference strains and cluster was determined by clustalW DNASTAR and NCBI DNA sequence blast.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>During the study period, 369 of the 491 gastroenteritis outbreaks had at least one stool specimen tested for norovirus and 270 outbreaks were confirmed to be caused by norovirus. Strains were characterized to be of genogroup I and II in 15 and 233 outbreaks respectively. Seven of the GI outbreaks (47%) were successfully sequenced and were characterized to be GI:1 (n=4), GI:2 (n=2), and GI:3 (n=1). Of the GII outbreaks, 171 (73%) were sequenced and 158 were characterized to be of GII:4 and 13 of other GII clusters. There was a shift in the GII:4 strains with the strains from Jan-Oct 2004 (n=12) closely linked to the Oxford-B5S10 (AY587988) and the strains from Oct 04-Dec 05 (n=144) closely related to a new variant found in Netherlands in 2004 (AY883096). GII:4 was the predominant circulating strain (124 of 135 sequenced) in long-term care facilities and in hospital-based outbreaks (19 of 19 sequenced). The non-GII:4 strains were found in various outbreak settings intermittently throughout the study period.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>GII:4 was the predominant norovirus stain found in gastroenteritis outbreaks from 2004 to 2005 with a shift in the subtype overtime. Other strains were more likely to be found in non-LTC and non-hospital outbreaks and circulated throughout the study period.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>First, to determine the distribution of HPV types and the epidemiology of HPV infection in a pre-vaccine population of Saskatchewan (SK) women referred to a colposcopy clinic. Second, to predict the efficiency of the new HPV vaccine for the effective management of cervical disease within SK.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>1355 specimens were collected from Jan 1998 through Feb 2005 from women referred to the colposcopy. HPV typing was performed using DNA sequencing based on primers for the L1 gene and E1 gene. Real-time E6 PCR was used to confirm HPV-16 and HPV-31 infections. Indeterminate samples after DNA sequencing were analyzed using Luminex&#x000ae; technology. The Chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were used to test significance. Odds ratios with 95% CI were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel test.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Fifteen of 330 specimens that were identified by DNA sequencing to harbour HPV-16 or HPV-31 were further resolved to be mixed 16/31 infections by real-time PCR. The Luminex method found 8/41 HPV sequencing indeterminates to be mixed infections. HPV typing using DNA sequencing can miss more than 85% of mixed HPV infections. HPV-52 is missed by L1 PCR using Gp5+ and Gp6+ primers. The NPV (0.91) of HPV DNA testing for &#x02265; CIN2 could be used to decide if triage to colposcopy is warranted. The identification of a low-risk genotype precludes, with reasonable certainty, the diagnosis of &#x02265; CIN2 (NPV 0.83). The risk of CIN associated with HPV-18 infection (0.4&#x02013;1.7) is substantially lower than either HPV-16 (3.6&#x02013;11.0) or HPV-31(1.8&#x02013;12.6).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The most commonly identified genotype was HPV-16 (18.2%) followed by HPV-31 (6.1%) and then HPV-18 (3.6%). HPV-18 is playing a smaller role in SK for CIN compared to other distribution patterns. The new cervical cancer vaccine is expected to cover 70% of women with cervical disease but HPV-16 and HPV-18 only represent 55% of the high types in SK colposcopy. The clinical significance of HPV-31 will depend on the level of cross protection by the vaccine.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Cases of WNV infection were first detected in Qu&#x000e9;bec in 2002. This is a first attempt to characterise the distribution of the virus in the general population in the province of Qu&#x000e9;bec. Prevalence of WNV infection was examined in blood donors in regions where WNV activity was detected in the previous 3 years.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Between February and April 2005 blood donors, presenting at H&#x000e9;ma-Qu&#x000e9;bec clinics in regions of Qu&#x000e9;bec where WNV was documented in birds and mosquitoes, were recruited to participate in the study. Blood samples were collected and tested for WNV antibodies. All specimens were first tested for WNV IgG using the Pan-Bio WNV EIA kit. All reactive specimens were tested for the presence of WNV IgM and further tested for the presence of IgG using a second WNV IgG EIA (Focus). Plaque neutralization test (PRNT) was used to confirm the cases. Dengue IgG EIA (Focus) and dengue virus PRNT were also used on selected samples.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A total of 3403 blood samples were collected. All were negative for WNV IgM. Fifty-six (56) samples were reactive for the IgG in both EIAs. PRNT confirmed the presence of specific WNV antibodies (titre range: 80 to &#x0003e;640) in 6/56 of the samples. Twenty (20/56) samples had a PRNT negative result for WNV but positive (titre &#x0003e;40) for dengue while 8 others gave a PRNT negative result for WNV, a positive result for dengue antibodies in EIA and a limited reactivity in dengue PRNT (titre &#x0003c;40). Twenty-two (22) samples although reactive in both WNV IgG EIA did not contain specific antibodies to WNV or dengue virus as established by PRNT.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Prevalence of WNV antibodies was 0.18% in the blood donor population. Dengue antibodies however were detected in at least 20 samples for a prevalence of 0.59%. Confirmatory testing is essential to distinguish between WNV and dengue (or other flavivirus) antibodies when a IgG positive result is obtained in a WNV specific EIA.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Because infections with <italic>C trachomatis</italic> [CT] and <italic>N gonor-rhoeae</italic> [GC] are often asymptomatic, existing liquid-based Pap [L-Pap] screening programmes may provide convenient samples for testing with commercial nucleic acid amplification assays.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>We enrolled 290 women attending a health clinic or street youth facility for the collection of a PreservCyt&#x000ae; ThinPrep&#x000ae; sample, and a cervical swab. The L-Pap sample was Pap-tested, then 1 ml was transferred into a liquid Pap transfer tube [LPT] for testing in the GenProbe APTIMA&#x000ae; assays [AC2, ACT, AGC]. The residual L-Pap sample was also tested for CT and GC using the Roche AMPLICOR&#x000ae; [AMP] and the Becton Dickinson ProbeTec&#x02122; [PT]. A CS was tested by AC2. A patient was considered infected if 2 specimens were positive or a single specimen was positive in 2 tests.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The prevalence of CT was 10% [29/290] and 2.4% [7/290] for GC. Most of the positive patients were reactive in all 3 assay systems [CT 21/29; GC 6/7]. Four patients were infected with both organisms. The percent sensitivity and specificity of the various tests on the specimen tested were as follows: for CT on L-Pap; ACT 100, 98.1; AC2 93.1, 98.8; AMP 86.2, 91.2; PT 72.4, 92.7: for GC on L-Pap: AGC 100, 100; AC2 100, 100; AMP 85.7, 100; PT 85.7, 100: for AC2 on CS [93.1, 98.5 for CT and 100,100 for GC]. The lower specificities of AMP and PT for CT may have been due to difficulties in removing all of the L-Pap fluid prior to the lysis step in the protocols. The higher sensitivities of AC2, ACT and AGC for both CT and GC on LPT may be due to greater analytical sensitivity of these assays.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The APTIMA&#x000ae; assays were more sensitive and specific than AMPLICOR&#x000ae; or ProbeTec&#x02122; for detecting women infected with CT &#x00026;/or GC by testing ThinPrep&#x000ae; samples.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Because of inherent inaccuracies, the clinical diagnosis of genital herpes must be confirmed by laboratory testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2). Commonly used HSV culture and antigen detection methods have limited sensitivity and cannot be practically used to identify asymptomatic cases. PCR and glycoprotein G-based HSV type-specific serology (TSS) have significant diagnostic advantages and their targeted use in specific clinical situations and in selected populations is of considerable benefit. Evidence-based guidelines were developed for the use of PCR and HSV TSS.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A literature search was performed to identify studies dealing with the laboratory diagnosis of genital herpes.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>For symptomatic cases, the PCR assay is the test of choice. HSV-2 TSS is recommended for patients with recurrent or atypical genital lesions in whom a diagnosis has not been confirmed by culture, antigen detection or PCR, and for asymptomatic patients who have a history suggestive of herpes. Both HSV-1 and -2 TSS should be used, as appropriate, in evaluating immune status in couples discordant for genital herpes, in asymptomatic pregnant women whose partners have a history of genital herpes, and to identify HSV susceptibility in women contemplating pregnancy or considering sexual partnership with an individual with a history of genital herpes. HSV-2 TSS testing is further recommended for patients diagnosed with HIV or at risk of its acquisition. The above should be done in conjunction with education on HSV and preventive counselling.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>, sub species <italic>pallidum</italic>. As the organism is difficult to culture in-vitro, serological testing is generally the method of choice for diagnosis. Traditionally, non-treponemal tests have been used for screening. More recently, with the introduction of automated assays, screening may be performed with a less labour intensive treponemal test. The laboratory evaluated five Enzyme Immunoassays (EIA's) and one Chemiluminescent immunoassay so as to compare with the manual Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) screening method.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Tests were performed at BCCDC as well as Alberta Provincial Laboratory (ProvLab). At BCCDC, all 6 commercial methods were tested against a panel of 256 archived sera. The three top performing assays; two EIA's (ICE Somagen, Enzygnost Dade-Behring) and one Chemiluminescent assay (Syphilis TP-Abbott Architect) were then tested against a second panel of 1,385 routine clinical and prenatal samples. At ProvLab 5 assays were tested in parallel on 248 archived specimens, and the chemiluminescent assay was subsequently tested on another panel due to specimen volume limitations. Three assays with the best performance were tested prospectively on 500 prenatal and 500 diagnostic specimens.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Results were compared to the current treponemal tests in use; <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic> Particle Agglutination (TPPA) and Fluorescent Antibody Absorption (FTA) tests. At BCCDC, the highest sensitivity, 96.0%, was obtained with the chemiluminescent Syphilis TP (Abbott) assay. Specificity of this assay was 99.9%. At ProvLab, Syphilis TP and Enzygnost gave sensitivities above 98% with specificities of 99&#x02013;100%.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>In this study, most kits performed well at both sites compared to the treponemal tests currently in use. Each automated method had advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, any of the top 3 automated treponemal assays could be used depending on the laboratory's requirements, clinical setting and budget allocations</p>

        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Retrospective review of all persons treated for syphilis between March 2004 and January 2006 when regular benzathine penicillin was not available to our clinic.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>17 persons were treated for syphilis in that time frame: 13 males and 4 females. Syphilis Stage: Primary = 2; Secondary = 6; Early latent = 2; Late latent = 7. One male was HIV positive. Four persons were treated with doxycycline because of penicillin allergy. Eight persons were lost to follow-up, however of the nine persons followed RPR titre decreased appropriately (4 fold within 6 months). Only one patient agreed to LP six months after therapy &#x02013; csf results were normal.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Oral amoxicillin/probenecid is a reasonable alternate therapy to IM benzathine penicillin. It has the advantage of achieving therapeutic levels in the CSF. However there are the potential disadvantages of GI intolerance and noncompliance.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Mutations in 2142 or 2143 positions in the 2-copy 23S rRNA gene of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>H pylori</italic>) are highly predictive of both in vitro clarithromycin resistance and failure of clarithromycin-containing treatment regimens. An assay to rapidly detect these mutations using rapid PCR and Pyrosequencing&#x02122;, a novel method of sequencing by synthesis, was developed and tested with a collection of Canadian <italic>H pylori</italic> isolates.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Forty-two <italic>H pylori</italic> isolates (24 clarithromycin-resistant, 18 clarithromycin-susceptible) were studied. A short 56 basepair 23S target region was rapidly amplified by PCR (Rapid Cycler II, Idaho Technology Inc). Pyrosequencing&#x02122; (Biotage LLC) of the amplicons was then performed. To increase assay speed and efficiency, a sequencing primer directly adjacent to the 2142 and 2143 positions was used.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Mutations at one of the 2 positions studied were present in 20/24 (83%) of clarithromycin-resistant isolates. Seventeen had identical mutations in both 23S gene copies: 13 with A2143G mutations and 4 with A2142G mutations. Three resistant isolates had a mutation in only one copy of the 23S gene (A2143A/G). Thus, an A to G mutation in either one or both copies of the 23S gene at position 2143 was present in 16/24 (66%) of resistant isolates There were no mutations in 17/18 (94%) susceptible isolates. A single-copy mutation was seen in one susceptible isolate (A2142A/G).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The Pyrosequencing&#x02122; assay developed was able to detect and differentiate mutations at positions 2142 and 2143 in either one or both copies of 23S rRNA gene. A high proportion of resistant isolates had mutations at the assay target region, but resistance not due to mutations at 2142 or 2143 was also seen. A prospective study is thus needed to determine the clinical utility of the assay in Canada. Further study is also warranted to see if the Pyrosequencing&#x02122; method can be applied after direct PCR amplification from clinical specimens such as stools and gastric biopsies.</p>

        <p>To evaluate the new VITEK&#x000ae; 2 <italic>Neisseria-Haemophilus</italic> (NH) identification card compared with a 16S rRNA gene sequencing reference method. The evaluation was performed at three laboratory sites.</p>

        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Thirty (30) challenge and 371 clinical and stock isolates were included in this study. The same challenge organisms were tested once at all three sites for a total of 90 results. For reproducibility testing, the nine ATCC&#x000ae; strains comprising the QC set were tested 20 times over a minimum of 10 days at all three sites. All microorganisms were tested on the NH card and an aliquot from the clinical and stock isolates was saved for 16s. Performance was assessed to be correct when the microorganism was identified as the only choice (with any level of confidence), or one of the multiple choices listed within a low discrimination result. Performance criteria were set at &#x02265; 95% overall correct identification (ID).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>For challenge microorganisms, there was 98% overall correct ID, 8% low discrimination, 2% incorrect ID and 0% unidentified. For clinical strains, there was 96.5% overall correct ID, 10.2% low discrimination, 2.7% incorrect ID (but within 95% CI), and 0.8% unidentified. The 2.7% (10/371) clinical isolates that gave an incorrect ID consisted of seven isolates correct to genus and three strains incorrect to genus. All Repro-QC testing yielded expected results within a 95% CI except for one microor-ganism that failed at one trial site, and one other strains, that failed at one trial site and across sites.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The results for the Repro-QC, challenge and clinical isolates tested indicate that the NH card meets all performance criteria within a &#x02265; 95% CI. The NH card met or exceeded all minimum performance criteria when used to test fresh or frozen clinical isolates.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Isolation and screening for Methicillin Resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) negatively impacts bed management in hospitals. Rapid PCR screening for MRSA was initiated to facilitate transfers out of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and reduction in bed closures due to MRSA throughout the hospital.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Data collection was initiated in September 2005 and included: wait times for ICU transfer (both into and out of the unit), numbers of patients accommodated in other patient care areas and bed closures due to MRSA both within and outside of the ICU. MRSA screening using the IDI-MRSA&#x02122; Assay (Infectio Diagnostic Inc, Canada) was initiated on Dec 7, 2005 and limited to ICU admissions and screening of roommate contacts of patients newly diagnosed with MRSA throughout the hospital. Data collection continued through June 30, 2006. A retrospective survey was also undertaken to allow comparison of bed utilization and isolation statistics for other patient care areas prior to (Jan-Mar, 2005), and following MRSA PCR implementation (Jan-Mar, 2006).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Between Dec. 7, 2005 and June 30, 2006 1420 MRSA PCR tests were performed. Wait times for transfer into or out of ICU were not affected. Bed closures due to MRSA in ICU were significantly reduced and isolation times for ICU admissions were cut in half. Outside of the ICU, isolation days related to contact with MRSA and bed days lost through bed closures were reduced.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Implementation of PCR screening for MRSA led to a reduction in total days of isolation, bed closures and bed days lost both within the ICU and on general hospital wards. The cost of PCR testing ($46.00/patient) is more than offset by the cost savings of reduction in isolation days, conservatively estimated at $76/day in the ICU. A potential additional benefit is improved isolation technique dedicated to those who truly require isolation precautions, rather than to the entire ICU population. Rates of nosocomial MRSA in ICU were significantly reduced (there are other contributing factors for this finding).</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>CBSN is a network of Canadian clinical laboratories. Each year, the first 20 clinical <italic>S aureus</italic> (SA) isolates from any specimen type are sent to a central laboratory site for characterization. This report describes MRSA received over the 4-year period from 2002 to 2005 in terms of their <italic>SCCmec</italic> type, Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) content, and their susceptibility profiles to anti-staphylococcal agents.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>All SA submitted during 2002&#x02013;5 underwent susceptibility testing by broth microdilution and oxacillin-screen plates as per Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. All isolates growing on the 6&#x003bc;g/mL oxacillin-screen agar were tested by <italic>mec</italic> PCR and all <italic>mec</italic>-positive isolates were recorded as MRSA. Determination of each isolates <italic>SCCmec</italic> type was performed by using a compilation of the Oliviera, Ma and Louie reference multiplexes and the Zhang method. PCR for the PVL-encoding gene, <italic>pvl</italic>, was also completed on all MRSA.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A total of 2,474 SA were received during the 2002&#x02013;2005 surveillance period. Of these, 228 (9%) were confirmed as MRSA. There was no temporal trend in the proportion of SA that was MRSA. Provinces/territories with the highest proportion of MRSA were Quebec (25%), Northwest Territories/Yukon/Nunavut (16%) and British Columbia (13%). The majority of MRSA were from non-sterile sites (95%) obtained from inpatients (69%). The proportion of all MRSA that contained <italic>SCCmec</italic> type II cassettes decreased over the 4-year period from 89% to 59% (p&#x0003c;0.0001) while the proportion that contained <italic>SCCmec</italic> type IV cassettes increased from 5% to 37% (p&#x0003c;0.0001) over the same period. A total of 20 (9%) MRSA were <italic>pvl</italic>-positive; all, but one, of the pvl-positive isolates contained <italic>SCCmec</italic> type IVa cassette. MRSA containing the <italic>SCCmec</italic> type IV cassette were significantly more susceptible to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and clindamycin compared to MRSA containing other <italic>SCCmec</italic> types (p&#x0003c;0.0001).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>The proportion of MRSA that contain <italic>SCCmec</italic> type IV cassettes and that are <italic>pvl</italic>-positive is increasing in Canada, while the proportion containing the <italic>SCCmec</italic> type II cassettes are in decline. MRSA containing <italic>SCCmec</italic> type IV cassettes are significantly more susceptible to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and clindamycin.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) was used since 1993 to resolve the status of patients with HIV-1 Western-Blot (WB) indeterminate results and to identify HIV-2 infection. In 2005, only 253 samples of the 2418 submitted to our laboratory for confirmatory analysis required RIPA testing. Although RIPA has a high specificity it is a labour intensive test. A confirmatory test, capable of identifying HIV-2 antibodies with an adequate specificity and a better turn-around time was needed. We evaluated the performance of INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score (LIA, Innogenetics) for the confirmation of HIV antibodies.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>During a 2 months period, 75 prospective samples for which a RIPA was required were also tested by LIA. For discordant results, previous or follow-up specimens were reviewed to establish the patient status.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Sixty-five (65) specimens were negative and two (2) were HIV-1 positive in both tests. There was eight (8) discordant results. Five (5) samples were LIA indeterminate and RIPA negative. All of them were low reactive on the screen test and for 2/5 patients follow up samples confirmed a non specific reaction in LIA. Three (3) samples were LIA negative/RIPA indeterminate. One was from an HIV PCR negative infant less than one year old. RIPA detected low levels of maternal antibodies that were not detected by LIA. The second was obtained from a patient with known non-specific reaction in RIPA (3 indeterminate results over a period of 4 months). The third sample was low reactive on AxSYM HIV1/2 gO and non reactive with GS HIV1/2 plus O EIA. No follow-up sample was available.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>LIA has an acceptable performance, is easy to use and has a low turn-around time. LIA was introduced in replacement of RIPA in confirmatory algorithm in February 2006. However, given the small number of samples tested and the fact that LIA is not licensed in Canada, LIA results were excluded from final interpretation.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>PCR remains a powerful tool in HIV and many other areas of molecular diagnostic testing. However, inhibitors of the PCR can be carried over during the sample extraction process leading to potentially &#x02018;false-negative&#x02019; test results. Here we describe how the NLHRS deals with these problematic samples which includes performing a positive control PCR test to ensure the sample is of good quality.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Over 200 problematic samples were reviewed in this study. Whole blood samples are initially processed using a whole blood extraction method (Roche). This method is also part of the kit insert protocol for further testing using the Amplicor HIV-1 DNA Test v1.5 (Roche Molecular Systems). After extraction, the sample consists of a crude cell lysate which is also used in several other in-house HIV and HTLV PCR tests in our testing algorithm. Samples are first tested for the human DQ-alpha gene. If positive, the sample continues on in our algorithm. If negative, samples are first diluted one-in-two (1/2) and again repeat tested on the DQ-alpha PCR test. If positive, the sample continues in our algorithm at the one-in-two dilution. If negative the original crude cell lysate is then applied to a QIAamp DNA blood kit column in a modified protocol and repeat tested on the DQ-alpha PCR.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>In 213 problematic samples recently identified, 148 initially identified as DQ-alpha PCR negative, were resolved simply by diluting the sample one-in-two. Sixty-five (65) samples required further purification using the QIAamp DNA column. All samples have been resolved using one or a combination of the above sample processing methods.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The need to perform a positive control PCR test to ensure the integrity of nucleic acids after sample extraction cannot be emphasized enough. It should be stated that labs that utilize silica lysis sample extraction methods such as QIAamp or Nuclisens may not experience a significant number of PCR failures due to sample inhibition. However, labs failing to perform this essential test still risk the possibility of generating &#x02018;false-negative&#x02019; test results. This scenario is a real-possibility even if kit controls are valid as these controls only monitor the PCR process itself.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The presence of HIV-1 non-B subtypes is increasing worldwide. This poses challenges to commercial diagnostic and clinical monitoring tests which are predominantly based on HIV-1 subtype B strains. Our objective in this study was to determine the HIV subtype and examine potential genetic diversity in the primer and probe region targeted by commercial HIV-1 viral RNA assays in a patient displaying discordant viral load values Here we describe the first HIV-1 H/J recombinant in Canada. In addition to identifying this recombinant, DNA sequence analysis revealed that genetic diversity between this recombinant and the primers and probes used in these assays can lead to underestimated (undetectable) viral load values.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Plasma HIV viral load testing using the bioMerieux Nuclisens HIV-1 QT, Bayer bDNA v 3.0 and Roche Cobas Amplicor Monitor v 1.5 were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequence analysis of the HIV-1 gag (963 bp), pol (1.5 kbp) and gp41-env (460 bp) gene regions were sequenced and analyzed by phyloge-netic analysis to determine the genetic subtype. Further sequence analysis of the gag gene region targeted by the bioMerieux Nuclisens QT and Roche Amplicor Monitor HIV-1 viral RNA assays was also performed.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Phylogenetic and recombinant identification analysis revealed this HIV infection to be subtype H in the gag gene region and subtype J in the combined pol-env gene regions. We have identified this strain as an HIV-1 H/J recombinant. Further sequence analysis of the gag gene region revealed that extensive sequence divergence exists between this strain and the primers and probes used in two commercial assays that target the gag gene region, most notably the bioMerieux Nuclisens QT assay.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>We have identified the first HIV-1 H/J recombinant in Canada. In light of increasing genetic diversity in HIV worldwide we recommend that DNA sequencing of HIV especially in the region targeted by primers and probes used in commercial molecular diagnostic and viral load tests be incorporated in clinical monitoring practices to ensure that commercial viral load (RNA) assays are capable of detecting and properly quantitating HIV.</p>

      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A patient history, physical and chart review was conducted to collect data on this case. Medline was searched using the following strings: &#x02018;CMV colitis&#x02019; and &#x02018;HIV&#x02019;. English articles including patients with CD4 counts &#x0003e;200 were obtained.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The patient was a 39 year old female with a known history of HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV). Co-morbidities included injection drug use, alcoholism and malnutrition. She initially presented with endoscopically documented Candida esophagitis and weight loss. There was no evidence of CMV disease on original small bowel biopsies. CD4 count done on index admission was 340 cells/&#x003bc;l (34%). She was discharged home after therapy for esophageal candidiasis. She returned to hospital 3 weeks later with abdominal pain and anorexia. She had clinical evidence of peritonitis and radiologic evidence of perforated viscus. She was taken to the operating room where multiple small and large bowel perforations were found. Pathology was consistent with CMV colitis with numerous CMV inclusion bodies identified throughout all biopsies of small and large bowel. A repeat CD4 count done on this admission was 270 cells/&#x003bc;l (34%). She was treated with intravenous ganciclovir and improved. Review of the literature yielded two previous case reports of CMV colitis occurring in HIV positive patients with comparable CD4 counts. These patients also had recent histories of esophageal candidiasis and longstanding history of alcoholism.</p>

        <p>We describe a case of CMV colitis in an HIV positive patient with a CD4 count of &#x0003e;50 cells/&#x003bc;l. This and the other two reported cases in the literature demonstrate that CMV colitis can occur in HIV patients whose CD4 counts are above 50 cells/&#x003bc;l. CMV colitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of any HIV positive patients presenting with lower gastrointestinal symptoms regardless of their CD4 counts. A history of Candida esophagitis, significant alcohol use and malnutrition may predispose to CMV colitis in HIV positive patients.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>In North America, tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) has been found in certain areas of western US and southern British Columbia (BC). The object of this study was to review the TBRF data collected during the past 13 years at BCCDC Laboratory Services to provide an overall snapshot of this disease in BC.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>One or more of the following tests were used to diagnose TBRF. Culture and microscopic examination: laboratory mice and later BSK-H media were used to culture <italic>Borrelia</italic> spirochetes. Microscopic examination was performed directly using dark field microscopy as well as using Giemsa stained preparation of EDTA blood samples. Immunofluorescent assay (IFA): Serology tests were done by Immunofluorescent Assays on <italic>Borrelia hermsii</italic> HS1 (ATCC 35209) coated slides. Western blot: GlpQ protein strips were used for the Western blot test. PCR: Real-time PCR was performed using the Roche LightCycler platform and targeted the integral outer membrane protein region. Melting curve analysis was used for the differentiation and confirmation of TBRF.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Between 1993 and 2005, samples from 231 patient cases were tested for TBRF in BC. From this test group, 32/265 (12%) cases were shown to have evidence of infection with <italic>Borrelia hermsii</italic> by a variety of methods including culture, microscopy of Giemsa stains, serology with or without Western blotting and PCR.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Our data suggest that TBRF is endemic in southern BC since all positive patients either live there or have been exposed in that area during their visit. <italic>Borrelia hermsii</italic> is the primary causative agent of TBRF. The main vector is the <italic>Ornithodoros hermsii</italic> tick. Due to the global warming effect, there is a potential that TBRF could increase as a bigger public health concern. Ongoing monitoring of trends are required for surveillance, for the further understanding of the host range, host distribution, and the relationship between host and the human cases in the endemic areas.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>In much of North America, the blacklegged tick, <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>, is the primary vector of <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, the etiological agent of Lyme disease (LD). Since 2002, approximately 8 human cases of LD have been reported in Nova Scotia. The objective of this study was to assess the temporal and spatial risk of human or animal exposure to <italic>B burgdorferi</italic>-infected ticks using passive and active surveillance strategies.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>The occurrence and distribution of BLTs in Nova Scotia has been monitored by passive surveillance since 2001. Ticks were submitted for identification and diagnostic testing by members of the public, veterinarians and medical professionals. In geographic localities where spatial and temporal clustering of BLTs was detected by passive surveillance, small mammal surveys and drag sampling were undertaking to define the extent of establishment of vector ticks and enzootic cycles of <italic>B burgdorferi</italic> transmission.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>From 2001 to present, &#x0003e;450 BLTs have been collected from a large number of widely separated localities in Nova Scotia. Most of the tick submissions consisted of small numbers of adult female ticks with little clustering of submissions in space and time. However, active surveillance in areas with repeated submissions of multiple tick specimens has uncovered established BLT populations near Lunenburg, Bedford and Liverpool. Based upon intensity and prevalence of immature ticks on small mammals, antibody prevalence in rodents, infection rates in host-seeking ticks, and clustering of human cases of LD, the enzootic cycle of LD transmission is most firmly established, and risk of exposure to infected ticks, is greatest near Lunenburg compared to the other two localities.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>These studies provide, for the first time, definitive evidence of endemic transmission of the LD agent in Nova Scotia. Although, risk of human exposure to infected ticks is greatest near Lunenburg, the range of tick populations continues to expand. These observations warrant heightened public and physician awareness, and possible implementation of tick control strategies, to minimize this public health threat.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Acanthamoeba is a water-borne, microscopic, parasite that may invade the cornea, causing a potentially devastating ocular disease known as Acanthamoeba keratitis. The infection occurs mostly in contact lens users. The primary risk factors are exposed to contaminated water sources and/or poor contact lens hygiene. The objective of this study is to review the 10 years data collected at the Parasitology Section of BCCDC Laboratory Services on Acanthamoeba infection.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>At BCCDC Laboratory Services, <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp culture was performed using corneal scrapings and/or contact lens case solution in collaboration with the Ophthalmologists. The Laboratory provides the Ophthalmologists with a pair of Non-nutrient-agar culture plate prelawned with a 24 hour growth of <italic>E coli</italic> or <italic>E aerogenes</italic>. During the corneal scraping procedure, the physician applies the corneal scrapings directly onto the agar plates. Contact lens solutions were directly placed on the culture plate. In the lab, the plates are kept at 22&#x000b0;C and examined microscopically on a regular basis for growth of <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> trophozoites up to 4 weeks.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Between January, 1997 and November 2006, samples from 72 patient corneal scrapings and/or contact solutions were cultured for <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. From this test group, 31/72 (43%) cases were shown to have evidence of infection with <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. The sample size as well as positive rate of Acanthamoeba infection started to increase from 2003.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Our data suggest that Acanthamoeba keratitis infection is steadily increasing in BC and mostly in younger age group ranged from 11&#x02013;25. The most likelihood of corneal infection with Acanthamoeba infection may be due to the poor hygiene practices.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) have replaced culture-based procedures in our laboratory algorithm for identification of respiratory viruses. We aimed to assess the impact of these changes on our etiological investigation of respiratory outbreaks in schools, hospitals and long term and assisted care (LTAC) centres.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs or throat swabs submitted as part of an outbreak investigation during 2004&#x02013;2006 were included in this study. Samples were from 57, 129 and 112 respiratory outbreaks in 2004, 2005 and 2006 (until Nov 20, 2006), respectively (total sample n=1575). In November 2005 the change in diagnostic algorithm meant that NP samples were first subjected to direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) testing for influenza (IFV) A and B, parainfluenza (PIV) 1&#x02013;3 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). If DFA positive results were obtained no further testing of the outbreak was undertaken. DFA-negative NP samples from undiagnosed outbreaks and all throat swab specimens from outbreaks were screened for a panel of viruses by NATs. Nucleic acid extraction was automated using the easyMAG&#x000ae; extractor (bioM&#x000e9;rieux). The panel included real-time PCR (undertaken using hydrolysis probes on the ABI 7500 SDS) or NASBA (undertaken using molecular beacon probes on the bioM&#x000e9;rieux easyQ&#x000ae; analyser) for identification of IFVA and B, PIV 1&#x02013;4, RSV, adenovirus (ADV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>More than 75% of outbreaks investigated for respiratory viruses had an etiological diagnosis using our new testing algorithm in 2005/2006. The main changes noted from the altered algorithm were identification of a higher number of mixed virus outbreaks, identification of hMPV associated with outbreaks and enhanced pick up of IFV, PIV and RSV positives missed by DFA. In 2005 and 2006 more than 76% of resolved outbreaks were associated with IFVA or IFVB. Other causes of outbreaks for 2005/2006 were RSV (7%), PIV (8%), hMPV (5%), ADV (1%) and non-IFV mixed outbreaks (3%).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>In our laboratory, the DFA/NAT testing combination is optimal for outbreak investigations. The DFA provides a rapid turnaround with NAT giving extra sensitivity and expanded target testing. Additional viruses will be added to the NAT panel to further enhance eti-ological diagnosis.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND</title>
        <p>Although excess deaths occur in pregnant women (PW) during flu pandemics, the impact of flu on PW during non-pandemic years is unclear, as the contribution of comorbidities (COM) is poorly described and existing data may not be generalizable. While US recommendations direct that all women who will be pregnant during flu season (FS) be vaccinated, Canadian recommendations include only PW with COM. This study determines if FS is associated with increased rates of respiratory-related hospitalizations (RRH) and office visits (RRV) among PW compared to rates in non-flu seasons and if these rates vary by trimester (TM) and presence of COM.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>This population-based cohort study comprised all NS women who gave birth between 1990&#x02013;2004. The NS Atlee Perinatal Database (NSAPD) was used to obtain dates of each TM and risk factors for severe flu. Start and stop dates for each FS were obtained from the NS Department of Health. Peri-flu season (PFS) was defined as Nov 1 to the start of FS, and the 2-weeks following FS. Non-flu season (NFS) was defined as days not within FS or PFS. RRH and RRV were obtained from the CIHI database and the MSI and linked to NSAPD. Rates of RRH and RRV were calculated for women whose pregnancy (by TM) occurred during a FS and compared with rates among women whose pregnancy was outside FS and to the year prior to pregnancy.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Of 134,188 women, 10% had COM. 513 (0.4%) women had a RRH and 33,775 (25%) had a RRV during pregnancy. Rates of RRH and RRV visits were higher in all TM compared to the year prior to pregnancy in both healthy women and women with COM. Third TM exposure to flu season was associated with a RR of RRH of 8.5 in women with COM and 5.2 in healthy women compared to the year prior to pregnancy and 2.7 and 2.4, respectively compared to third TM exposure to NFS.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>PW are at increased risk of RRH and RRV during FS even in the absence of COM. NACI flu vaccine recommendations should be expanded to include all PW.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To examine the business case for replacing viral cell culture on DFA-negative specimens for the detection of respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal washes (NPW:s) using a commercially available multiplex PCR assay (Genaco ResPlex I&#x00026;II).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>1,742 of our routine NPW:s submitted to our clinical diagnostics laboratory for respiratory pathogen testing by DFA [RSV, Influenza A/B, PIV1,2,3, adeno] and culture during three months of the 2006 respiratory disease peak season were analyzed in parallel by our routine diagnostics and Genaco ResPlex assays.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>60% of submitted specimens were DFA negative and therefore reflected to classical virus culture. Culture was slow (1&#x02013;2 weeks TAT), detects limited amount of viruses, expensive (minimum $55), and detected a relevant viral pathogen in less than 10% of DFA negative specimens. Excellent levels of concordance between our standard methods and the Genaco system were observed. However, the Genaco assays were much faster (1 day TAT as opposed to 1&#x02013;2 weeks) and detected a broader spectrum of pathogens than viral cell culture, including bacterial agents and hMPV. In addition it detected coinfections which preliminary data suggests in some cases may have clinical significance. Overall it provided medical benefits at a better cost on a per-result basis than viral cell culture [approximately $320/assay with 75% of assays giving results, yielding an overall &#x02018;cost per diagnostics result&#x02019; of $426 for resPlex assays; $55/assay with less than 10% resulting, or a minimum of $550 per diagnostic result for culture].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Based on our results, we suggest that it would be cost effective and enhance clinical practice to replace viral culture with the Genaco ResPlex I/II assays for DFA negative specimens. While maintaining the rapid, cost-effective approach of DFA for first-line specimen analysis, this would allow detection of the causative agent in approximately 40% more patient specimens and decrease TAT from 1&#x02013;2 weeks (culture) to next day (Genaco). Compared to viral culture, the Genaco assays will decrease cost per medically relevant diagnosis and improve patient safety and medical management both through a decrease in TAT and in capacity to detect a much wider range of relevant agents.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The NLHRS previously eliminated the HTLV Western blot (WB) test from its algorithm approximately 5 years ago due to the higher than acceptable number of indeterminate final results from samples that were likely negative. Several Canadian labs performing HTLV testing have continued to use the WB test in their algorithms. We decided to reexamine this test and compared it against an HTLV PCR. Here we present results from this study.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>One-hundred (100) whole blood samples previously submitted and confirmed by HTLV PCR testing were used in this study. Sixty-seven (68) were diagnosed as HTLV positive and thirty-two (32) were diagnosed as HTLV-negative by HTLV PCR. Samples were processed for both proviral DNA and plasma which was stored at &#x02013;20C. The MP Diagnostics (formerly Genelab Diagnostics) HTLV Blot 2.4 was used according to manufacturer's instructions The test uses a combination of cell-culture derived viral particles and recombinant proteins. These include MTA-1 and K55 to further distinguish HTLV-I and HTLV-II and GD21, a common yet specific protein for both virus types. The HTLV PCR testing algorithm includes two different in-house nested PCR tests that can distinguish between HTLV-I and HTLV-II.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Of the 68 samples previously diagnosed as HTLV-positive by PCR, 62 were also confirmed as positive by Western blot. WB test results from the other 6 were; 1-negative, 1-indeterminate, 4-HTLV pos but untypeable). Of the 32 samples diagnosed as HTLV-negative by PCR, 8 were diagnosed as negative by the Western blot. However, 24 were diagnosed as indeterminate. Different banding patterns were observed but the most common cross-reactive bands included those from the gag (p19, p24, p28, p53) and pol (p26, p32, p36) gene regions.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The HTLV Western blot displayed very poor performance especially on samples previously diagnosed as negative by HTLV PCR. This would potentially have led to a significant number of reports with indeterminate test results and unresolved HTLV status.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>In 2003, the National Microbiology Laboratory formed the Microbiological Emergency Response Team (MERT) to respond to Bioterrorism and infectious disease outbreaks in Canada and Internationally. MERT is part of the Joint National Chemical Biological and Radio-Nuclear Response Team and the laboratory has been utilized for public health investigations Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (Iran), SARS virus (Hong Kong and Guangzhou, PRC), Ebola virus (Republic of Congo), Nipah virus (Bangladesh) and Marburg virus (Angola)</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>The Laboratory is highly mobile since all equipment and reagents can be transported as checked luggage. The response time is 2 hours from activation to deployment and MERT is capable of performing molecular diagnosis of all &#x02018;A&#x02019; list BT agents in the field setting. Chain of custody is maintained and the team members have been trained to work with forensic RCMP officers in the hot zone as well as being trained to act as expert witnesses in court.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Real time PCR using the Smartcycler instrument has been shown to be very reliable in the field setting. The field tests are sensitive, specific and accurate. Most recently, in March of 2005, Marburg virus was found to be the cause of an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever that was centered in Uige, Angola. As part of the international assistance team, coordinated by the World Health Organization, the Public Health Agency of Canada operated a field laboratory based at the Uige Provincial Hospital from April to June 2005. The Uige-based laboratory tested samples, including blood and oral swabs, from patients, victims and suspicious deaths and was able to provide diagnostic test results routinely within 4 hours of sample receipt. Confirmation on local testing was provided by the CDC laboratory in Luanda and agreement on test results exceeded 97%.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>On the basis of our experience the timely provision of accurate test results justifies future on-site diagnostic support.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Polymyxin B (PB) is a polycationic antibiotic effective in the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. Nevertheless, the clinical use of PB is limited due to its nephrotoxicity and neuromuscular blockade. Entrapment of antibiotics in liposomes is known to enhance their antimicrobial activities while minimizing their toxic effects.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>PB was incorporated into liposomes composed of either dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and cholesterol (Chol) or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and Chol in a molar ratio of 2:1. Entrapment efficiency in formulations prepared by sonication or extrusion methods was calculated as the % of PB incorporated into liposomes relative to the initial total amount of drug in solution. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of free or liposomal PB were determined by the agar dilution method. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic that prevented the appearance of a visible growth within the inoculion area after 18 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The concentrations of PB were measured by a microbiological assay.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Sonicated DPPC/Chol liposomes had significantly greater (p&#x0003c;0.05) encapsulation efficiency (32.1&#x000b1;2.43%) than sonicated POPC/Chol liposomes ((5.35&#x000b1;0.32%) or extruded DPPC/Chol liposomes (3.23&#x000b1;0.46) and extruded POPC/Chol (5.1&#x000b1;0.37%). Incubation of DPPC/Chol liposomes containing PB in serum at 37&#x000b0;C resulted in a complete release of the antibiotic into the biological fluid after 3 h as compared to 6 h in the case of POPC/Chol liposomes. Spontaneous release of PB from DPPC/Chol liposomes incubated in PBS was significantly higher (70%) than that from POPC/Chol liposomes (26%) after 48 h at 37&#x000b0;C. With respect to the antimicrobial activities of the liposomal PB formulations, the MICs of DPPC/Chol liposomes against several strains of Gram-negative bacteria (<italic>P aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>B bronchiseptica</italic>, <italic>E coli</italic>) were generally lower when compared to POPC/Chol liposomal PB or free PB. The combination of free drug and plain liposomes had an antibacterial activity similar to that of free antibiotic.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Incorporation of PB in liposomes appears to be more effective in the management of Gram-negative infections induced by these microorganisms.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>
          <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> are gram-negative bacteria which have emerged as serious opportunistic pathogens in individuals with cystic fibrosis. These strains are capable of intrinsic resistance to many different aminoglycoside antibiotics including tobramycin through different resistance mechanisms such as reducing membrane permeability. We developed a liposomal-bismuth formulation encapsulating tobramycin to alter bacterial resistance to this antibiotic.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>The liposomal-bismuth formulation was prepared by the dehydration-rehydration method and its size was measured using the dynamic light scattering technique. The encapsulation efficiency of this liposomal formulation was determined by microbiological assay and its stability in biological fluid was evaluated for a period of 48hrs. Minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) of free and liposomal-bismuth encapsulated tobramycin were determined with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>B Burkholderia cepacia</italic> strains isolated from CF patients.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The size of this liposomal formulation was 407.7 &#x000b1; 33.6 nm with an encapsulation efficiency value of 2.45 &#x000b1; 0.1% The liposomes retained respectively 74.7 &#x000b1; 0.13 % and 70.6 &#x000b1; 0.15% of their tobramycin content in PBS at 4&#x000b0;C and at 37&#x000b0;C during the 48 hours time-period. However, this retention was decreased to 65.8 &#x000b1; 1.91% when incubated in plasma at 37&#x000b0;C during same time-period. Interestingly, the highly resistant strains of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> became susceptible to tobramycin when it is encapsulated in liposomal-bismuth formulation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The novel liposomal-bismuth formulation could be utilized as a new strategy of drug delivery system to lower drug quantity and enhance efficacy of existing drugs against resistant microorganisms that commonly affect individuals with cystic fibrosis.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common and are associated with significant morbidity. The objective of this study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibilities of urinary tract isolates from hospitalized patients admitted to a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Toronto.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>All non-duplicate urinary tract isolates from inpatients between June 1-July 31 2006 were identified using standard methods. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of gram-negative bacilli were done using Vitek&#x000ae; 2 AST-NO19 cards. CLSI criteria were used to determine antimicrobial resistance and to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A total of 432 (28%) of 1571 urines cultured yielded significant growth, including 80% that were hospital-acquired. The most common organisms identified were: <italic>E coli</italic> (EC, 35%), <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp (23%), <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (KP, 10%), and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA,7%). No MRSA or VRE were identified; there were 5 (4%) ESBL-producing <italic>E coli</italic>. The susceptibility test results are summarized in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jidmm18035">Table</xref>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Ciprofloxacin resistance in EC (25%) and PA (44%) is increasing. PA also had high rates of resistance to ceftazidime (36%) and carbapenems (20%). Knowledge of these antimicrobial resistance rates is important, as these trends may influence the empiric antimicrobial therapy of UTIs in hospitalized patients.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Here we report, to our knowledge, the first Group B Streptococcus (GBS) necrotizing fasciitis (NF) in an older healthy child with no predisposing conditions and a review of the literature of pediatric GBS NF cases.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A MEDLINE search from 1966 to 2006 of the English literature was performed using the search terms: &#x0201c;Group B Streptococcus&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;<italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;necrotizing fasciitis&#x0201d; as well as article references to locate cases of GBS as the only pathogen of NF in children.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>We describe a 10 month old term infant who presented with NF of her lower abdomen caused by GBS. She had no underlying medical conditions or definable immunodeficiency. Debridement was performed and intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg) was given within 12 hours. She recovered well with 14 days total of intravenous antibiotic therapy. A review of the literature revealed 18 previously reported cases of NF with GBS as the sole pathogen. Four of these cases were children: 5 and 7 weeks, five months and 10 years of age. All four of these children had predisposing factors, including low birth weight, prematurity and recent surgery. All cases were treated with a penicillin and underwent debridement within 1 to 21 days. All cases survived with minimal morbidity.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare presentation of invasive Group B streptococcal disease in children. Outcomes are excellent when antimicrobial therapy is instituted early and debridement is utilized. Though GBS NF has only previously been reported in children with underlying conditions, our case suggests that GBS should be considered a pathogen of NF in children of all ages with or without underlying conditions.</p>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p>With the declining incidence in <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> serotype B (Hib) since the introduction of the Hib vaccine in 1992, there is a concern regarding the replacement with other capsular invasive serotypes. We carried out a retrospective review of cases and isolated analysis of invasive serotype A <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (Hia) involving patients admitted to the Health Sciences Centre (HSC) in Winnipeg, Manitoba from 2000&#x02013;2005.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Patients with invasive Hia disease were identified through the electronic database of the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of the Health Sciences Centre. Charts were reviewed and data was collected in the following areas: demographics, co-morbidities, symptoms at presentation, clinical course, treatment, and outcomes. Isolates were analyzed for biotype, genotype and antimicrobial susceptibility.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Hia represented 25 of the 55 total invasive Hi cases. The number of cases per year did not vary during the study duration from 2000&#x02013;2005. 17/25 cases were male. Ages ranged from 1 month to 86 years, with 19/25 cases occurring in children 2 years or younger. The majority of cases (18/26) were from Northern Manitoba and Nunavut. Clinical diagnoses included: meningitis (5), pneumonia (10), septic arthritis (5), cellulitis (2), and bacteremia (3). Mean duration of hospital stay was 14.4 days (range 0 to 66 days). Three patients died (12%) and an additional 3 had subsequent neurological dysfunction. Twenty-five isolates were analysed. All were biotype II and demonstrated identical or highly similar DNA fingerprinting. One isolate was ampicillin resistant.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Serotype A is currently the most common capsular serotype identified in Manitoba. Severe Hia disease is observed mainly in children less than 2 years living in northern communities and Nunavut. Invasive disease caused by Hia is varied in its clinical presentation, with pneumonia, meningitis and septic arthritis being the most common. The majority of infections resulted in severe disease, as indicated by prolonged hospital stay and significant morbidity and mortality. Isolates analyzed may reflect clonal expansion of the bacterium.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>1) To describe the local epidemiology, treatment and outcomes of SAB; and 2) To examine the management patterns of infectious diseases (ID) and non-ID physicians prior to local practice guidelines.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Retrospective cohort study. All adult patients (&#x02265; 16 years) with SAB admitted to our teaching hospitals (600 total acute care beds) between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2003, identified through lab records, were eligible. Only the first episode of SAB was included; patients with neutropenia, polymicrobial bacteremia or death prior to recognition of SAB were excluded. Details regarding demographics, co-morbidities and management were obtained from the medical record.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Ninety-nine patient records have been reviewed (age range 16&#x02013;92 years, mean = 61 years, 68% male). SAB was health care-associated in 75% and hospital-acquired in 62%. Twenty percent of patients had pre-existing valvular heart disease, 11% had prosthetic valves and 23% had other prosthetic devices. The most common sources of infection were intravenous lines (22%), skin and soft tissue (22%) and surgical sites (12%); the source was unknown in 29%. A clinical diagnosis of endocarditis was made in 18% and confirmed by echocardiography in 8/18 (44%). Primary treatment most commonly included cefazolin (28%) or cloxacillin (27%). Adjunctive gentamicin was used in 33% of patients and rifampin in 16%. Treatment duration was highly variable (range 1&#x02013;270 days, mean = 35 days; mean duration of IV antibiotics = 33 days). Patients with line-associated SAB or SAB of unknown source received a shorter duration of antibiotics than those with a clinical or echocardiographic diagnosis of endocarditis. Consultation to ID was made in 50% of cases; all ID recommendations were followed in 84%.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>SAB is common and its management variable in the absence of a practice guideline. Variations in management allow assessment of treatment factors which independently predict adverse outcomes. This data is critical to the development of detailed practice guidelines addressing the optimal investigation, antibiotic agent(s), duration of treatment and adjunctive interventions needed to optimize outcomes in SAB.</p>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p>Underutilization of vaccines is a significant public health problem. Adult immunization rates in Canada fall below desired targets. Barriers to immunization include inadequate public education about vaccines, lack of access, &#x00026; convenience issues. Pharmacists are highly accessible professionals who could potentially increase immunization rates among Canadian adults by administering vaccines. Most Canadian jurisdictions do not permit pharmacists to immunize; however, pharmacist immunizer models are successfully employed in other countries. We sought to determine Canadian pharmacists&#x02019; knowledge, attitudes &#x00026; beliefs about immunization, and to understand potential barriers to pharmacists acting as immunizers.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>An internet-based survey was emailed to 4154 community pharmacists practicing in Canada in July 2006. The survey was piloted through focus groups for qualitative feedback and tested for content validity and test-restest reliability.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>There were 492 responses (12%). Responses were received from all provinces and territories. 44% were pharmacy owners or managers. The majority (96%) agreed that increasing immunization coverage rates is important and that pharmacists as immunizers would increase public access (90%), improve coverage rates (88%), and be acceptable to the public (85%). However, only 72% agreed that pharmacists should be permitted to immunize; 51% said they are willing to incorporate immunization into their practice if permitted, and 24% remained unsure. Only 20% described their current training as adequate, 97% agreed more professional training would be required to administer immunizations safely, and 90% agreed that certification in vaccine administration should be required. Pharmacists identified liability, reimbursement, and negative interactions with other providers as important barriers to pharmacists administering vaccines.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Pharmacists could be important resources to increase adult vaccine coverage rates in Canada. Most are willing to expand their practice scope to include immunization. However, implementation of any practice change would require professional development and certification in vaccine administration. Policy will need to be informed by issues such as reimbursement and liability.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>In recent years <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> associated disease (CDAD) has emerged as an important nosocomial infection. Hyperproduction of toxin has been suggested as a basis for increased virulence of some <italic>C difficile</italic> strains. Our objective was to compare the toxin B titre in stools directly and from in vitro cultures of clinical isolates.</p>

        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Nineteen consecutive stool samples positive for <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin were collected and analyzed immediately. Toxin B titres were performed on the stool supernatants. The stools were cultured to obtain the <italic>C difficile</italic> isolate and these were grown in BHI for 72 hour cultures to determine the Toxin B titre. Growth curves were determined for 3 strains of <italic>C difficile</italic>. Viable counts of <italic>C difficile</italic> cultures in BHI (Difco) were performed on CDMN agar (Oxoid, Nepean ON). Toxin B titres were performed using HFF cells and reported as cpe unit/mL (cpe U/mL).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The median Toxin B titre in stools was 10,000 cpe U/mL (range; 100 to 100,000 cpe U/mL). For broth cultures of the isolates the median titre was 1,000 cpe U/mL (range; 10 to 10,000 cpe U/mL). Analysis by linear regression gave r=0.7539, r<sup>2</sup>=0.5683 and P=0.0002. Control strains, ATCC 43255 and ATCC 43594 produced maximum Toxin B titres of 100,000 and 100 cpe U/mL respectively. A NAP1b clinical isolate produced a maximum Toxin B titre of 10,000 cpe U/mL. All isolates had similar viable counts when the Toxin B titre was tested.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>There was a linear relationship between the toxin B titre in stools compared to broth cultures. Our data indicated that a high titre of Toxin B (&#x02265; 100,000 cpe units/mL) in stool of patients with CDAD was uncommon. Toxin B titre in stool tended to be about 10 fold higher compared to the broth titre for the corresponding isolate. ATCC 43255 and the NAP1b strain (known to be toxin hyperproducing strains) both produced high Toxin B titres in the in vitro cultures. This suggests that patients infected with the NAP1b strain would have higher Toxin B titres in their stool compared to median level in stools of CDAD patients infected with non-NAP1 isolates.</p>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p>The clinical presentation of human metapneu-movirus (hMPV) community acquired pneumonia (CAP) has not been well described in adults. We sought to better detail the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic characteristics of hMPV CAP.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>From August 2004 through March 2006, consecutive adults from 7 emergency departments and hospitals were prospectively entered into a study of the etiology of CAP (defined as acute illness with two or more typical symptoms or signs plus radiographic infiltrates). Symptom severity was graded using a previously validated 6 point scale ranging from no (0) to very severe (5) symptoms. Blood and sputum cultures and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were obtained according to study protocol. NP swabs were processed for hMPV using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction that we have previously validated as both sensitive and specific (Lee et al. J. Med. Virol. 2006).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A total of 308 patients were enrolled in the study and 216 had evaluable NP samples collected. Overall, 8 (4%) had hMPV detected by NP swab without evidence of co-infection with other micro-organisms and were considered to have hMPV CAP. Their mean age was 62 years (range 31&#x02013;91) and 5 (63%) were female. 50% of patients had severe pneumonia (class IV or V) based on Pneumonia Severity Index Score. All hMPV cases occurred between December and April. All patients had underlying cardiac (7/8) and/or pulmonary (5/8) disease. Most patients (7/8) presented with cough, dyspnea and fatigue; conversely, only 1 patient had myalgias, only 1 had gastrointestinal illness, and only 1 patient was febrile (mean temperature 37.6&#x000b0;C). The leukocyte count was normal (4.5&#x02013;11) in 7 (88%) patients. Infiltrates could be seen in either upper (3/8), mid-zone (4/8) or lower lobes (5/8) and in 50% of radiographs it was multi-lobar. Small pleural effusions were seen in 4 (50%) patients. All patients received empiric therapy with levofloxacin. No patient died. Average length of stay was 7 days (range 2 to 11 days).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>hMPV is an important cause of viral pneumonia, comprising at least 4% of all CAP in our cohort. It seems clinically indistinguishable from other causes of CAP, but should be considered during the influenza season in older adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease who do not have a prominent fever or leukocytosis.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND</title>
        <p>Although inadequate antimicrobial therapy has been demonstrated in multiple studies to increase the risk for death in bacterial infections, few data investigating the effect of anti-fungal therapies on outcome of serious fungal disease are available. The objective of this study was to assess the adequacy of empiric therapy and its effect on mortality outcome of invasive <italic>Candida</italic> species infections.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A population-based cohort study of all patients with <italic>Candida</italic> species cultured from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid was conducted. Adequacy of empiric therapy was assessed according to published guidelines.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>During a five year period, 207 patients had an invasive <italic>Candida</italic> species infection identified; in 199 cases adequate data were available for assessment of treatment and outcome to hospital discharge. Fifty-two percent (103) of cases were due to <italic>C albicans</italic>, 44 (22%) <italic>C glabrata</italic>, and the remainder due to other species. Between the time of culture draw and reporting of a positive culture, only 121 (61%) patients were treated with adequate therapy. Empiric therapies consisted of fluconazole in 108 (54%), amphotericin B deoxycholate in 49 (25%), liposomal amphotericin B in 5 (3%), and caspofungin in 3 (2%) of patients; 34 (17%) patients had no documentation of receipt of any antifungal therapy. Patients who did not receive adequate empiric therapy were at a significant two-fold higher risk for in-hospital mortality as compared to those treated adequately [47/78 (60%) vs 35/121 (29%); risk ratio 2.1; 95% confidence interval 1.49&#x02013;2.90; p&#x0003c;0.0001). Among the 165 patients that received any empiric therapy, patients with inadequate therapy were more likely to have received flu-conazole, be infected with species other than <italic>C albicans</italic>, and/or be older as compared to patients that received adequate empiric therapy (p&#x0003c;0.005 for each).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Inadequate empiric therapy is common and associated with increased risk for death among patients with invasive <italic>Candida</italic> species infections.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>
          <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> is an aerobic gram negative non fermentative rod found ubiquitously in the environment, including soil, manure and water. This is an uncommon cause of human disease but has been implicated in rare cases of pneumonia, meningitis, prosthetic valve endocarditis, aortofemoral graft infections, endolphthalmitis, ecthyma gangrenosum, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. In addition, there have been several cases of septicemia in immunocompro-mised patients as well as outbreaks associated with contaminated hemodialysis fluids.

        <title>CASE REPORT</title>
        <p>45 year old woman with a past medical history of Crohn's disease, mixed connective tissue disorder and chronic steroid use presents to the ED following a moped accident with a laceration over her right knee and superficial wounds over her right leg. The laceration was cleaned and sutured and she was discharged home. She was well until 2 weeks later when her right knee and leg began to swell and her wounds were not healing. She denied having fevers or night sweats but complained of chills. Review of systems was otherwise unremarkable. <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> was isolated from blood cultures and knee joint aspirate. She was treated with IV ceftriaxone and discharged home without any further sequelae.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>
          <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> is an uncommon human pathogen. We report a case of <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> septic arthritis and bacteremia following traumatic inoculation in an immunocompromised host.

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Urine cultures are often obtained from hospitalized patients. Antimicrobial therapy of asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) may contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The objectives of this study were 1) to describe the characteristics of hospitalized patients that have a urine culture ordered; and 2) to determine the appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy in response to urine culture results.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>From June 1-July 31 2006, the medical records of all patients with a positive urine culture (PUC) and selected patients with negative urine cultures (NUC) were reviewed in order to obtain clinical and demographic information. A symptomatic UTI was defined as the presence of a PUC in a patient with urinary symptoms. AB was defined as a PUC in patients without urinary symptoms and no infection at another site.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The medical services ordered 54 urine cultures per 1000 patient days, the surgical services ordered 47 urine cultures per 1000 patient days, and the ICU ordered 135 urine cultures per 1000 patient days. Medical records were available for 339 patients, of whom 126 had PUC and 213 had NUC. 168 (49.6%) urine specimens were collected via an indwelling catheter, with 106 (31.2%) collected as a midstream urine. Urinalysis (55.8%) and blood cultures (50.9%) often were ordered along with urine cultures. Fever (34.1%) and confusion (56.6%) were the most common indications provided, with urinary symptoms (15.3%) rarely listed. Only 25.4% of patients with PUC met criteria for a symptomatic UTI, with most PUC being in patients with an infection at another site (21.8%) or AB (52.4%). Symptomatic UTIs were treated with antibiotics 90.6% of the time. AB was treated with antibiotics 65.1% of the time for 282 antibiotic days. Confused patients were more likely to be treated for AB than were patients who were not confused (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=6.20, p&#x0003c;0.025). The most common antibiotics used to treat presumed UTIs were ciprofloxacin (52.6%), ampicillin (23.1%), and cotrimoxazole (15.4%).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Urine cultures are often obtained from hospitalized patients, but most PUC are from patients who do not have any urinary symptoms. AB is often treated inappropriately with antibiotics in these patients. Therefore, educating staff to only order urine cultures in patients with urinary symptoms or unexplained fever may help reduce the inappropriate treatment of AB with antibiotics.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To compare the frequency of blood and body fluid exposure reporting before and after the implementation of a structured system designed to increase reporting and facilitate management in the Capital Health Region, Edmonton, Alberta.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Data were collected prospectively from the introduction of the &#x0201c;Stick to it&#x0201d; exposure injury reporting program on September 25, 2002, and compared with retrospective data that were extracted from exposure-related laboratory testing in the 29 months preceding program introduction. Exposure injury was defined as exposure to blood, needlestick or other body fluids that may place a healthcare worker at risk for blood-borne infection.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Following implementation of &#x0201c;Stick to it&#x0201d; (October 2002-June 2006), there were an average of 62 reported exposures per month (2802 reports in 45 months), as compared with 34 reports per month (984 reports) in the 29 months preceding program introduction. Of the 3786 reported exposures between April 2000 - June 2006, 426 (11% of all exposures) involved at least one blood-borne pathogen. This 11% rate has remained constant over time, independent of program introduction. Hepatitis C virus was the most common source infection (84%), followed by human immunodeficiency virus infection (12%), and hepatitis B infection (5%).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Approximately 2 exposure injuries are reported per day in this large Canadian health region. 11% of injuries are associated with at least one blood-borne pathogen. Employee awareness, education, and around the clock reporting services such as the &#x0201c;Stick to It&#x0201d; program may prove effective in increasing the frequency of injury reporting, and thus access to counselling, care and improved prevention.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>
          <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> has caused numerous outbreaks associated with increased morbidity and mortality throughout North America and parts of Europe in recent years. Sequencing and analysis of an isolate belonging to the predominant outbreak-associated <italic>C difficile</italic> strain was performed to identify potential virulence factors useful for improved molecular diagnostic techniques.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A clinical isolate of <italic>C difficile</italic>, QCD-32g58, was isolated in pure culture and confirmed to be an outbreak-associated clone. Genomic DNA was extracted, followed by whole-genome shotgun sequencing using the ultra-high-throughput Genome Sequencer 20 system. Finishing was performed by PCR-directed gap closure. Automated genome annotation used the Bacterial Annotation System, with subsequent manual editing. Data was visualized on the Generic Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomequebec.mcgill.ca/compgen/c.difficile/index.html">http://www.genomequebec.mcgill.ca/compgen/c.difficile/index.html</ext-link>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Whole genome sequencing at a 20-fold depth of coverage led to an initial assembly of 3.8 Mb. Subsequent finishing has resulted in a genome of 4.1 Mb (GenBank accession AAML00000000), encoding approximately 4300 genes. Sequence accuracy of over 99.99% was observed following resequencing of 35 kb encompassing known pathogenicity genes. We identified over 200 established or putative virulence factor genes, including toxin genes, regulatory genes and genes involved in antibiotic resistance, sporulation, flagella production and cell-surface adhesion. A gene locus homologous to a regulator of toxin production in other <italic>Clostridium</italic> species was found immediately adjacent to the binary toxin locus.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>
          <italic>C difficile</italic> QCD-32g58 possesses genetic markers identical to the predominant outbreak strain. Following complete genome sequencing, over 200 putative virulence genes have been identified. A comparative genomics approach, involving the sequencing of outbreak and non-outbreak isolates, is now being used to evaluate allelic diversity and determine genes and polymorphisms specific to outbreak strains. This data will be used for development of improved diagnostic assays and molecular epidemiologic tools, as well as identification and analysis of mechanisms of pathogenicity.

        <p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is grouped into 8 different genotypes, A to H, based on 8% or greater nucleotide divergence within the viral genome. Very little is known regarding the epidemiology, replication, and natural history of genotype G HBV. To investigate the possibility that genotype G requires co-infection with a helper HBV, as suggested from numerous case reports, the viral quasispecies were characterized from the sera of genotype G-infected Canadian patients. Full-length genome sequencing was further performed on two isolates showing unique characteristics.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Sera obtained from 10 genotype G-infected patients were extracted for HBV DNA. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of approximately 20 clones derived from the amplified HBsAg-coding region was performed to determine the genotype of each quasispecies clone. Genotype-specific nested and real time PCR as well as line probe assay analysis (INNO-LiPA, Innogenetics Inc) was performed to verify the genotype designation and increase the sensitivity of detecting minority quasispecies. Sequence recombination was investigated by SimPlot analysis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A total of 27 serum samples containing genotype G HBV were analyzed by clonal analysis and genotype-specific PCR. Consecutive samples taken at 6-month intervals were available for 6 patients. All sera, except those from one patient, demonstrated co-infection with both genotype A and G HBV. Genotype G quasispecies were observed in the minority during co-infection, except in two cases; a genotype A/G recombinant, and a possible genotype G monoinfection. The putative monoinfected patient was consistently HBeAg positive, despite the presence of stop codon mutations within the HBeAg-coding region, suggesting the presence of an alternate expression pathway. Recombination between genotypes A and G was observed in the majority of quasispecies analyzed from the second patient, with several breakpoints over the length of the viral genome.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>The majority of genotype G infections in Canada occur in the context of co-infection or recombination with genotype A, suggesting genotype G strains are defective. However, monoinfection with genotype G may occur. Phenotypic analysis of such monoinfected strains is required to investigate replication competency.</p>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p>Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways have the potential to influence susceptibility to HIV infection through a number of mechanisms including signaling innate antiviral responses, directing HIV-specific adaptive immune responses, and/or influencing immune activation. We therefore assessed TLR expression and cytokine responses to TLR ligands and their association with HIV-1 resistance in the Kenya sex-worker cohort.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cervical mononuclear cells (CMCs) were isolated from HIV-1 resistant women (HIV-R), HIV-1 uninfected susceptible controls (HIV-S) and HIV-1 infected women (HIV+). TLR1-TLR10 mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR, and cell-surface protein expression of TLRs-1, -2, and -4 was assessed by flow cytometry. TLR functionality was evaluated by cytokine responses from TLR-ligand stimulation in short-term ex-vivo culture.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Peripheral blood TLR expression as determined by both RT-PCR and surface expression was not significantly different between HIV-R and HIV-S; however, TLRs-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -10 mRNA (relative to housekeeping genes L32 and 18s mRNA) were significantly elevated in HIV+ compared to uninfected subjects (P&#x0003c;.05). This effect was not seen in surface protein expression of TLR-1, -2, and -4, suggesting either undetected protein forms, or divergent post-transcriptional signaling. Cytokine responses to TLR ligands in PBMCs of HIV-R subjects tended to be similar to HIV-S and HIV+ showing higher TNF-a and IL-10 responses to stimulation of the surface expressed TLRs than the endosomally expressed TLRs (P&#x0003c;.05). Interestingly, in a subset of subjects evaluated, broadly reduced TLR mRNA expression (relative to housekeeping gene L32) was observed in genital tract CMCs of HIV-R compared with HIV-S or HIV+ (significant for TLRs 1,2,4,5,6,8, and 10 (P&#x0003c;.001)). Expanded studies are underway to delineate the compartmentalization of the genital tract findings.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Our data demonstrate novel peripheral blood TLR expression differences in HIV infected versus uninfected individuals, and genital tract TLR expression differences associated with HIV-1 resistance. The later provides an intriguing innate correlate of HIV-1 immunity that could influence mucosal HIV-1 vaccine adjuvant, or microbicide design.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>WinRho&#x000ae; SDF is human immunoglobulin derived from the pooled plasma of anti-D donors, which is used to suppress the immune response of non-sensitized Rh<sub>o</sub> (D) negative individuals who receive Rh<sub>o</sub>(D) positive RBCs and for the treatment of Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP). To investigate whether the presence of immunoglobulins in the WinRho&#x000ae; SDF product may have implications on subsequent varicella or rubella efficacy, we screened the WinRho&#x000ae; SDF product using three commercially available EIA kits for the presence of VZV and rubella virus IgG.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>The WinRho&#x000ae; SDF product was tested in triplicate alongside clinical samples, and negative controls on three commercial EIA kits (Meddens Diagnostic, Euroimmun and Dade Behring VZV IgG and Rubella IgG). WinRho&#x000ae; SDF product was tested as a serum sample according to manufacturer's instructions.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>All three commercial kits revealed positive results for VZV and Rubella IgG immunoglobulins in the WinRho&#x000ae; product. Data from the Euroimmun and Dade Behring kits showed positive values for VZV and rubella IgG. Quantitative data from the Meddens commercial kit revealed a high positive VZV IgG and Rubella IgG in the WinRho&#x000ae; SDF product.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Our data shows that the WinRho&#x000ae; SDF product contains VZV IgG and rubella IgG antibodies. Further studies would be needed to determine the biological significance of these antibodies on subsequent varicella or rubella immunization.</p>

        <p>44 non-duplicate multiresistant <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> (with reduced susceptibility to imipenem, zone diameter &#x02264;17mm) were collected from a surveillance project covering 12 major teaching hospitals in Guangzhou, PRC in 2000&#x02013;2001. The presence of metallo-&#x003b2;-lactamase (MBL) genes and their associated genetic contexts were investigated.</p>

        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>PCR screening for IMP/VIM/GIM and SPM metallo-&#x003b2;-lactamase genes and a multiplex real-time PCR designed for detecting integron integrases were used to screen for Class 1, 2 and 3 integrons and MBLs in these clinical isolates. Further characterisation of Class 1 inte-grons was carried out by using PCR mapping with primers specific in 5&#x02032;CS and 3&#x02032;CS and in resistance genes, followed by sequencing of the obtained amplicons. Plasmid isolation (Hynes et al, 1986) and hybridisation with specific probes were used to confirm the location of the integrons. RAPD was used for typing of the genomic DNA of these isolates.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>All 44 isolates were negative for Class 2 and 3 integrons with 23/44 positive for the Class 1 integrase gene. Only the <italic>bla</italic>
          <sub>IMP-9</sub> MBL gene was detected, in six out of 44 isolates. Five main types (I-V) of Class 1 integrons were found using PCR mapping with 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; CS primers among the 23 positive isolates, with 2&#x0223c;4 cassettes found in each integron. Aminoglycoside resistance genes are most commonly found in these integrons, which were found to be associated with either a 450kb or a 150kb plasmid. RAPD showed both clonal and nonclonal patterns among the isolates from different centres. The <italic>bla</italic>
          <sub>IMP-9</sub> gene was found to be located in another Class 1 integron which is not belong to the five main types (without 3&#x02032;CS) which was only associated with the six isolates carrying the Type I integron.
        </p>

      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>A clustered distribution of certain types of Class 1 integrons that are located on similar large plasmids in <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> isolated from the Guangzhou area suggest the dissemination of the resistances, including carbapenem resistance, through horizontal gene transfer. The 38 MBL negative strains suggest that mechanisms other than acquisition of MBLs, such as efflux pumps, may also contribute to non-susceptibility to imipenem in these isolates.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND</title>
        <p>
          <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>P.a</italic>) is associated with serious infections and poses a therapeutic dilemma due to inherent and acquired resistance. Recent studies have reported an association between the use of broad spectrum fluoroquinolones (FQs), which have less activity against <italic>P.a</italic>, and the emergence of ciprofloxacin (CIP) resistance.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>PURPOSE</title>
        <p>To describe the relationship between the use of specific FQs and the emergence of CIP resistance, two hospitals were compared, one (A) that mainly used CIP and the other (B) levofloxacin (LEVO).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Pharmacy databases were used to calculate the amount (defined daily doses (DDD)/1000 patient days (PD)) of each FQ dispensed. <italic>P.a</italic> resistance rates (%R) were compiled from the clinical microbiology databases.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>
          <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jidmm18035">Table 1</xref> shows that CIP and total FQ use in hospital A has been increasing by 55.7% and 37.2% respectively, over the 5 yr period analysed, with stable <italic>P.a</italic> CIP %R. Hospital B's use of LEVO has decreased by 31% over the 5 yrs, with CIP %R following a similar trend.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>CIP is a narrow spectrum FQ with the greatest activity against <italic>P.a</italic> in its class. As demonstrated by hospital A, there is no increased CIP resistance with its use. The decreased use of LEVO in hospital B appears to be associated with decreased <italic>P.a</italic> CIP %R. This finding suggests that broad spectrum FQ may contribute to the selection of CIP resistant P.a strains which is in keeping with previously published studies.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Patients with allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) generally have sinus mucus collected and sent for fungal culture. <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and the dematiaceous fungi are often isolated from these cases. The recovery from sinus washings of the basidiomycete anamorph <italic>Spiniger meineckellus</italic> (teleomorph <italic>Heterobasidion annosum</italic>) &#x02013; a fungus known to be a tree pathogen common to the temperate conifer forests of British Columbia &#x02013; prompted a microbiological and clinical investigation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Sinus washings from patients with AFRS were cultured using conventional mycological media. Fungal isolates were examined microscopically and macroscopically for identification purposes. Isolates requiring specialized identification were sent to a reference laboratory for confirmation. We performed a chart review of the patients in whom <italic>Spiniger meineckellus</italic> was found in order to extract clinical data.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A total of 5 cases were identified in which <italic>Spiniger meineckel-lus</italic> was isolated from sinus fungal culture. The isolates demonstrated characteristic microscopic features including conidiophores with swollen ends producing conidia from short stalks and absence of clamp connections. Allergic mucin was noted in 3/5 of the patients. All 5 patients had presentations clinically consistent with AFRS.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>
          <italic>Spiniger meineckellus</italic> has not been previously reported as a human pathogen. Our recovery of this fungus only from sinus washings of AFRS patients suggests that <italic>Spiniger meineckellus</italic> may have some role in the pathogenesis of AFRS.

        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Two different integrons were found in each of five <italic>bla</italic>
          <sub>IMP-9</sub>-carrying P aeruginosa isolated from 4 different medical centers. One Class 1 integron carried three resistance genes: <italic>aac</italic>A4, <italic>bla</italic>
          <sub>IMP-9</sub> and <italic>aac</italic>A4; left of the integrase gene intI1 there are Tn21-like transposon genes <italic>tnp</italic>A-<italic>tnp</italic>R-<italic>tnp</italic>M; and downstream of the cassettes there is a complete tni module (<italic>tni</italic>R-<italic>tni</italic>Q-<italic>tni</italic>B-<italic>tni</italic>A) &#x0223c;98% similar to that of Tn402. The <italic>tni</italic>A gene was disrupted by a mosaic <italic>mer</italic> operon whose overall nucleotide homology was closest to Tn5041 (85% identity). A second Class I integron carried resistance genes <italic>aac</italic>A4-<italic>cat</italic>B8 and <italic>bla</italic>
          <sub>OXA-10</sub>; this integron was found to be associated with a 3&#x02032;-conserved segment downstream. Both integrons were found to be located on a 450kb conjugative plasmid. RAPD typing showed that the isolates were not identical but could be related.

        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>1.The existence of two Class I integrons on a 450kb plasmid in five <italic>bla</italic>
          <sub>IMP-9</sub> carrying <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> isolated from four hospitals in China strongly suggests a horizontal transfer in dissemination of <italic>bla</italic>
          <sub>IMP-9</sub> mediated carbapenem resistance. 2. Linkage of the blaIMP-9 gene with the <italic>mer</italic> and <italic>tni</italic> modules indicates an origin from an ancestral integron which has never acquired <italic>qacE</italic> and <italic>sul1</italic>; such integrons will escape mapping using 5&#x02032;-CS and 3&#x02032;-CS primers. 3. Judging from the cassette contents and their associated mobile elements, we propose that the two integrons were introduced into the host cell as different events under various selective antibiotic pressures in clinical settings.

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is essential for the differentiation, proliferation and maturation of lymphocytes. The IL-7 receptor is comprised of a unique a-chain (CD127), and a common -chain (CD132) that is shared among members of the -cytokine family of receptors. We have shown that IL-7 down regulates expression of CD127 on CD8 T-cells at the level of transcription. Our objective was to (a) define the minimal CD127 gene promoter, and (b) identify promoter elements responsible for IL-7 mediated suppression.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Genomic DNA was isolated from Jurkat cells and used to amplify by PCR various fragments of the human CD127 putative promoter. These fragments were inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in the pGLb vector. Primary CD8 T-cells were isolated from PBMC of healthy donors and transfected with the promoter constructs via Nucleofection. Cells were co-transfected with a second plasmid encoding pMaxGFP to control for transfection efficiency. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 hours in media alone or with IL-7 before being assayed for reporter gene expression.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The CD127 promoter fragment extending from the TATA-box (position 0) to &#x02013;258bp demonstrated the greatest transcriptional activity in primary CD8 T-cells. Promoter fragments containing sequences extending sequentially further upstream (from 0 to &#x02013;560, &#x02013;1100, &#x02013;1300, and &#x02013;3000bp) demonstrated incrementally less luciferase expression. This may be anticipated as fragments extending beyond &#x02013;258bp contain one or more Gfi-1 binding sites, a known repressor of CD127 transcription in CD8 T-cells. Consistent with our mRNA data, addition of IL-7 to the culture media resulted in the down regulation of luciferase expression from the CD127 promoter constructs. Interestingly, all promoter fragments tested were down regulated by IL-7 suggesting the IL-7 responsive transcriptional element is contained within the minimal promoter (TATA-box to &#x02013;258bp).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>This is the first report of a detailed characterization of the human CD127 gene promoter and its response to IL-7. We have defined the minimal promoter and shown that this promoter fragment can be suppressed by IL-7. Future work includes a mutational analysis of the minimal promoter to define transcription factor binding sites responsible for IL-7 dependent repression of transcription.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND</title>
        <p>Blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) has become a standard mode of treatment for haematological disorders. Following transplantation, BMT recipients become susceptible to vaccine-preventable infections, and are recommended to receive the paediatric schedule of vaccinations one year post-transplant, with the exception of pertussis vaccine. Currently, there have been no published reports on the safety and immunogenicity of adult formulation acellular pertussis vaccine in this population.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>To conduct a pilot study examining the safety and immunogenicity of adult formulation tetanus and diphtheria toxoids adsorbed combined with acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine in post-BMT recipients.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Patients were recruited from among those being followed one year following allogeneic or autologous BMT at the QEII Health Sciences Centre. Inclusion criteria included BMT within the last calendar year, age between 11&#x02013;64, and no previous vaccinations post-transplant. Exclusion criteria included chronic active graft-versus-host disease, active infection, or disease relapse. Following informed consent, patients had a baseline blood draw, and then were given one dose of Tdap in their non-dominant deltoid. Blood was drawn again one month later to determine the level of immunity to four pertussis antigens (FHA, FIM, PT, PRN) as compared to baseline. Patients were followed closely by phone to elicit any adverse effects.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>At present, 5 patients (3 autologous, 2 allogeneic) have been recruited into the study. Following administration of the vaccine, no injection site tenderness, heat, or swelling were observed. There were no systemic symptoms. Prior to vaccination, no patient had detectable antibodies to pertussis. Following vaccination, antibody levels were increased, however they remained barely detectable and far below those achieved by those with intact immune systems.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Tdap has been recommended for all Canadian adults; however, no data existed as to the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in BMT recipients. The study subjects had no immune memory for pertussis; this was not improved with one dose of vaccine. It appears that multiple doses will be needed to develop protective immunity. The lack of adverse effects suggests that Tdap may be safe in this population; however larger clinical trials are needed.</p>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p>The gold standard for detection of <italic>Giardia</italic> in water is the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Method 1623. This approach simultaneously detects <italic>Giardia</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> using filtration, immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and immunofluorescence assay (FA). This method is capable of detection only to the <italic>Giardia</italic> genus level and therefore molecular analyses are crucial in understanding sources, transmission and health risks of <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> in water supplies.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>In this study, standard detection of <italic>Giardia</italic> in water was supplemented with molecular analyses. Surface water was collected biweekly in the Township of Langley, British Columbia, over a two-year period. Sewage and animal scats were also collected for source tracking purposes. Genotyping was achieved by nested PCR and sequencing of two loci, the beta-giardin gene and the triosephosphate isomerase gene. These sequences were compared to archived historical BC samples and to published sequences.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>
          <italic>Giardia</italic> was frequently detected (85% of samples) in surface water in the Township of Langley. Concentrations ranged from zero to 260 cysts per 100L of water and peaked in the late summer and early fall. All <italic>G. lamblia</italic> isolates genotyped to date belonged to Assemblages A and B and demonstrated greater sequence homology to historical BC samples than to published sequences. Only 3.4% of scat samples were positive for <italic>Giardia</italic>.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>It is well documented that only one <italic>Giardia</italic> species (<italic>G. lamblia</italic>) and two of its genotypes (Assemblages A and B) are human-infective. This study identified that surface water in the Township of Langley is impacted by <italic>Giardia</italic> and that the isolates collected could infect humans. The small number of positive animal scats and the difficulty in obtaining sewage samples limits the source tracking potential of the study. This data is expected to have a significant impact on disease surveillance and prevention initiatives aimed at reducing the impact of water quality on infectious diseases.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Cystic echinococcosis is caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> which is widely distributed in regions all over the world. This helminth is known to be present endemically in British Columbia. Humans serve as accidental intermediate hosts. Human hosts develop larval cysts in any organ, though the liver is by far the most common location, followed by the lung. We present a case of echinococcosis in a 59 year old female, review of laboratory diagnosis and the epidemiology in BC.</p>

        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A 59 year old woman from Vancouver presented with a one year history of vague, right-upper quadrant abdominal discomfort. An initial ultrasound revealed a large multicystic mass in the right lobe of the liver measuring 22 &#x000d7; 16 &#x000d7; 12 cm. Other than the mild, intermittent discomfort, she was asymptomatic. Now living in Vancouver, the patient had moved from a small rural town in southern Italy 22 years ago.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A routine investigation and ELISA serology were performed. CBC and liver enzymes were within normal limits. ELISA for echinococ-cus was positive, though echinococcosis immunoblot was negative. The patient was sent for surgical consultation and pretreated with albendazole prior to surgery. The hydatid cyst was aspirated, and hypertonic saline was instilled prior to removal of the cyst. Samples of the aspirate were microscopically examined (100&#x02013;400&#x000d7;), many characteristic hydatid cyst structures were seen including brood capsules, invaginated and evaginated protoscolices, rostellum and hooklets. A review of cases of Hydatid Disease detected in BC was carried out.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Echinococcosis is endemic in many regions of the world. This case demonstrates the salient features of a typical clinical presentation, the diagnosis and treatment. Although this may represent as an imported case, it is important to recognize that there are also endemic cases in British Columbia. Results of our review of cases diagnosed in the last 10 years at BCCDC are presented.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Nasal swab (NS) collection for diagnosis of respiratory viruses is less invasive than nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). Recently, we found that newly designed NS were essentially equivalent to NPS in sampling respiratory epithelial cells. In this study, we assessed the feasibility and quality of self-sampled NS compared with staff-collection.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>We enrolled 35 volunteers, each of whom collected two self-administered NS (round and flat) using written and illustrated instructions; followed by another two NS (round and flat) collected by trained staff. The order of NS type was randomized. Discomfort, ease of administration, and preferences were assessed using a Likert scale. Swabs were placed in 1.0 mL Copan Universal Transport Medium, vortexed and centrifuged, and pellets resuspended in 1.0 mL of PBS. 25 microL suspensions were placed in wells on a glass slide, dried, fixed and counterstained with FITC labeled mono-clonal antibody. Respiratory epithelial cells were enumerated using a fluorescent microscope at 400&#x000d7; magnification by an experienced microscopist blinded to swab type and administration. An average count from 4 fields was calculated when 10 or more epithelial cells were present per high-powered field (hpf); 10 fields were averaged if there was fewer than 10 cells/hpf.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Among the 35 subjects, the mean (SD) cell yields for round swabs were 81.1 (44.8) and 43.2 (38.1) for researcher- and self-administered NS respectively (P&#x0003c;0.001); cell yields for flat swabs were 76.6 (45.0) and 36.0 (29.9) (P&#x0003c;0.001). While round NS collected more cells than flat NS, the difference was not statistically significant. However, using a widely-accepted definition of an adequate diagnostic smear of greater than 25 epithelial cells/smear, 69 of 70 self-collected and all 70 staff-collected specimens were of adequate quality. Overall, both flat and round NS were well tolerated with 75% of volunteers reporting no or mild discomfort. Self-administration of NS was easy (97%) and a majority of individuals (75%) were either neutral or preferred self-collection.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Self-administered nasal sampling was easy, preferred, but may be inferior to staff-collected swabs for sampling the upper respiratory tract. Studies with clinical correlation are now needed.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a major cause of hospitalization of infants and children. This study describes the epidemiology, microbiologic diagnostic testing methods, and treatment of pediatric patients hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections at Kingston General Hospital (KGH), the regional referral hospital for rural and small communities in Southeastern Ontario between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</title>
        <p>What types of acute LRTI are present in the pediatric population admitted to Kingston General Hospital (KGH)? What types of microbiology laboratory diagnostic tests are performed? How do these microbial test results affect patient management?</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A total of 91 patient medical records were reviewed.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>40% were aged 6 months or less. 57.1% of children from Kingston area, and 77.8% of children transferred from regional hospitals, including Moose Factory in the northern James Bay area, were admitted during evenings and nights, when rapid diagnostic testing was not always available. 57% were hospitalized for 1 to 3 days. 70% and 30% were diagnosed with bronchiolitis and pneumonia respectively. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), identified by direct antigen detection, was the most frequent agent (47%) identified. One patient was co-infected with RSV as well as pertussis (identified by PCR). Rhinovirus, parainfluenza and RSV were identified by viral culture. Antibiotics were administered in 57.1%. 44%, who subsequently were diagnosed with RSV bronchiolitis, received antibiotics before the microbial diagnostic test result was available. No high risk infant receiving RSV monoclonal antibody prophylaxis required hospitalization. There were no deaths.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Because of the short duration of hospitalization, results of bacterial and viral cultures and PCR tests that were sent to another centre for processing were of limited clinical use. The availability of rapid diagnostic tests, including PCR, is beneficial in the management of pediatric patients with LRTIs, not only in determining the appropriate use of antimicrobials but also in reducing nosocomial infections by cohorting children. The future availability of immunization to prevent disease due to RSV could have a significant impact on hospitalization of children with LRTIs.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease and the cause of cervical cancer and other anogenital malignancies. The recent introduction of an effective vaccine against HPV types 16 and 18 will increase the demand of type specific epi-demiological studies. The objective was to develop an assay using Luminex technology that will rapidly and correctly genotype all 46 mucosal HPV types in single and multiple infections.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Amplified single stranded HPV DNA carrying a biotin tag was generated using MY09/MY11 and GP5+/GP6+ nested PCR. This DNA was allowed to hybridize to 46 uniquely colour coded microspheres, each with attached 30MER probes; which consist of a specific sequence for each of the mucosal HPV types. A streptavidin-phycoerythrin reporter binds to the biotin tag. Through flow cytometry the Luminex technology sorts each microsphere set and measures the intensity of fluorescence emitted by the phycoerythrin for each microsphere set. From this data the genotypes of HPV samples can be determined.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Our Luminex method can identify 41 HPV types without any cross hybridization. The probes of types 34, 68, 69, 71 and 85 appear to be specific but their sensitivity could not yet be tested for lack of suitable standards. Using separately amplified plasmid standards, we were able to correctly identify up to 36 different HPV types in the same reaction. However, the PCR method used for amplification is not ideal for amplifying multiple types in clinical specimens. Two hundred ninety two clinical samples taken from HIV positive women were tested. Compared to linear array used as a gold standard, the luminex assay shows high specificity for single and multiple infections. Sensitivity of the luminex assay is 96% for a single HPV type but decreases with multiple types and is 15% in infections with 4 types or more.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Through the use of Luminex technology mucosal HPV types tested can be accurately and rapidly identified. Compared to conventional methods this assay provides a simpler, less subjective method to genotype HPVs resulting in quicker turnaround times and reduced costs.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>(i) To understand what is taught to trainees in health professional programs regarding vaccines and how it is taught; (ii) To assess vaccine knowledge and attitudes of students graduating from undergraduate health professional programs; and (iii) To establish a platform from which to develop an interprofessional education program.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>(i) A 5-part questionnaire was sent to all Canadian nursing, medical and pharmacy schools to assess immunization-related curriculum content; information was elaborated by phone interview; (ii) A 77-item web-based, validated questionnaire was emailed to final-year students in medicine, nursing, and pharmacy at Dalhousie Univ and St FX Univ School of Nursing to assess knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors reflecting current immunization curriculum.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The curriculum review yielded responses from 18%, 48%, and 56% of medical, nursing, and pharmacy schools, respectively. Time spent on immunization content varied substantially between and within disciplines from &#x0003c;1 to &#x0003e;50 hrs. Most schools reported some content regarding vaccine preventable diseases, immunization practice and clinical skills but there was considerable variability and fewer schools had learning objectives or formal testing in these areas. Gaps in knowledge of vaccine indications/contraindications and safety were identified in all programs (mean correct = 13.5/21); 33.4% of trainees were unsure if there is a relationship between pertussis vaccine and sudden infant death syndrome and 22.3% were unsure whether current evidence supports a link between vaccines and chronic diseases. 74% of respondents don&#x02019;t feel comfortable discussing vaccine side effects with parents/patients and only 21% felt they received adequate teaching regarding immunization during training.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Important gaps were identified in knowledge of graduating nursing, medical, and pharmacy trainees regarding vaccine indications/contraindications, adverse events and safety. The national curriculum review revealed wide variability in immunization curriculum content and evaluation. The results suggest that all HCP trainees could benefit from development of core objectives for immunization providers and comprehensive, interprofessional education strategies to achieve these objectives during training.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND</title>
        <p>Multi-drug resistant <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MDR-TB) accounts for significant morbidity and mortality globally. With the standard anti-tuberculous drugs now more than 40 years old, a critical component of the global fight against tuberculosis is the search for new tuberculosis drugs. This study assesses the anti-mycobacterial activity of five traditional medicinal plants.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>This study suggests that aqueous extracts of the root of <italic>H. maximum</italic> and <italic>A. calamus</italic> possess strong anti-tuberculous activity though further study is needed to identify the active components. This also validates traditional knowledge and adds to the growing literature of anti-mycobacterial botanical compounds.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>DRAB is a nosocomial pathogen. Globally many Intensive Care Units have their own endemic strain. Some patients become colonised with the organism, with no adverse effect, whereas others have life-threatening infections. DRAB can be resistant to many antimicrobial agents and treatment of infections is increasingly difficult due to the dwindling choice of active agents. There is an urgent need for new agents active against DRAB and our objective was to contribute to this search.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>The antimicrobial activity of a novel aqueous allicin extract (AB1000) was tested against 11 clinical isolates of DRAB. The allicin content of AB1000 was confirmed using HPLC. Strains were screened for activity using agar diffusion methods, MICs and MBCs were carried out and growth (using spectroscopy at 490nm) and killing curves (using viable counts) for selected organisms were determined.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>In agar diffusion tests using AB1000 concentrations ranging from 125 to 1000mg/l were made up in aqueous solution. Zone diameters on Oxoid Muller Hinton agar ranged from 14mm to 31mm, slightly but not significantly smaller than the zones found with Oxoid Isosensitest agar of 20mm to 34mm. At 500mg/l the zone sizes for the 11 strains tested varied from 22&#x02013;29mm with an average zone diameter of 26.3mm and a mode diameter of 27mm. Minimum inhibitory concentrations varied from</p>
        <p>15mg/l to 62.5mg l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with a mode concentration of 62.5mg l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Minimum bactericidal concentrations varied from 62.5 to 125mg l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. In growth curves, when compared to the allicin free control, growth at sub-inhibitory concentrations was delayed by 1&#x02013;2hrs at 15mg/l and by 3&#x02013;4hrs at 31mg l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. At 62.5mg l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> growth was completely inhibited. In killing curves using AB1000 at a concentration of 500mg l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, growth was reduced by 30% in 1 hour and by 99.9997% at six hours. This represented a reduction in cfu ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> from Log 7.3 to Log 3.8 cfu ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. At 24hrs no growth was detected.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Allicin (AB1000) was shown to be bactericidal against DRAB at pharmacokinetically achievable concentrations. Killing curve data shows antibacterial activity begins within the first hour of contact. We have also demonstrated that sub-inhibitory concentrations as low as 15mg l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> can reduce growth.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The objective of this study was to validate Dalbavancin (DAL) Etest&#x000ae; (ET) versus broth microdilution (BMD) MICs against 100 clinical strains of gram-positive bacteria.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>DAL (0.004 &#x02013; 4.0 &#x003bc;g/mL) was tested against 100 clinical strains of staphylococci (55), streptococci (25), and enterococci (20) with susceptible and resistant phenotypes to other agents included. Vancomycin (VAN 0.25 &#x02013; 256 &#x003bc;g/mL) was a comparator agent to assure stability of phenotypes. BMD for DAL was performed in cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton (CAMHB) broth (CLSI M7-A6) with 0.002% v/v P80 added to the microdilution wells and DAL prepared in DMSO. CAMHB alone was used for VAN. 5% sheep blood was added for testing of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and beta-hemolytic streptococci. For ET, MHA plates (5% sheep blood added for streptococci and <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>; 2% NaCl for MRSA) were inoculated with bacteria according to CLSI document M2-A8. ET strips were added according to AB BIODISK recommendations. CLSI quality control organisms were tested daily. DAL MICs for ET vs BMD were performed and percent essential agreement (EA) within +/&#x02212; one doubling dilution was determined.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The EA for DAL was 88% and for VAN was 97%. For both agents 47% of strains had identical MICs by both methods. All results were within +/&#x02212; 2 dilutions. There was a one dilution lower bias for VAN MICs with ET that was not observed with DAL. Except for 2 GISA strains (DAL MICs of 0.5 &#x02013; 1.0 &#x003bc;g/mL) and four <italic>vanA</italic> enterococci (MICs of &#x02265;4 &#x003bc;g/mL) the MIC range for DAL for all other strains was 0.004 &#x02013; 0.12 &#x003bc;g/mL.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>For susceptibility testing of DAL, ET is comparable to BMD using the CLSI approved addition of 0.002% P80 to the dilution wells and DMSO as the solvent and intermediate diluent for preparation of DAL. ET can be used to accurately measure MICs of gram-positive clinical isolates to DAL.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Although <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is the most common bacterial cause of CAP, Enterobacteriaceae may be a cause of CAP in patients with underlying comorbid illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We used pooled data from 6 CAP trials to compare the clinical and microbiological efficacy of sequential IV/PO moxifloxacin (MXF) with comparator (COMP) therapy in patients with CAP due to Enterobacteriaceae.</p>

        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Data were pooled from 6 sequential (IV/PO) trials of 400mg IV/PO MXF in the treatment of mild, moderate and severe CAP in hospitalized patients. COMP treatment consisted of ceftriaxone + erythromy-cin, amoxicillin/clavulanate &#x000b1; clarithromycin, trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone &#x000b1; azithromycin &#x000b1; metronidazole or ceftriaxone + levofloxacin.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The 6 trials randomized 3015 patients (1494 MXF, 1521 COMP) of which 2288 were valid per protocol (pp) (1141 MXF, 1147 COMP). Of the valid pp patients, 342 (30.0%) MXF and 361 (31.5%) COMP-treated subjects were also microbiologically valid. Of these 27 (7.9%) MXF and 15 (4.2%) COMP-treated subjects had Enterobacteriaceae isolated from sputum or blood cultures. The following individual organisms were isolated (MXF, COMP): <italic>E coli</italic> (3, 6), <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp (19, 8), <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> (1, 0), <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> (1, 0), <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> (0, 1) and <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> (3, 0). The overall clinical and bacteriological success rates in these patients were 22/27 (81.5%) and 21/27 (77.8%) for MXF and 10/15 (67.0%) and 10/15 (67.0%) for COMP-treated patients.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Inappropriate antimicrobial (ABx) use has been linked to poor outcomes, emergence of resistance, and increased costs. A preprinted antimicrobial order form (AOF) providing defined criteria for the use of selected ABx was implemented in April 2006 in a 1000 bed tertiary care hospital. Use of the form and documentation of the indication was required. The objective was to determine if compliance with ABx restrictions improved from May &#x02013; July 2005 (pre-AOF) to May &#x02013; July 2006 (post-AOF).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Patients were randomly selected and reviewed retrospectively for appropriateness of use of ceftriaxone (CTX), meropenem (MER), flu-conazole (FLU), and levofloxacin (LEV) (n=40 each), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) (n=84). Demographics, lab and culture data, ABx regimen and indication were collected. Appropriateness of use was independently assessed by 3 blinded reviewers. Differences analyzed using Fisher's exact.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Overall, appropriate use increased from 57% pre-AOF to 65% post-AOF (p=0.24). Rates varied by drug and by the treating service. Appropriate use of CIP improved from 17% to 52% (p=0.0011). Indications for CIP use included intra-abdominal infections (21.4%), resistant gram negative infections (16.7%) and resistant urinary tract infections (UTI) (11.9%). Inappropriate use of CIP was most commonly for prophylaxis after surgery (19.0%) and empiric treatment of UTI (16.7%). No significant improvement in appropriate use was observed for CTX (75% vs 80%, p=1.00), MER (80% vs 55%, p=0.97), LEV (70% vs 65%, p=1.00) or FLU (85% vs 85%, p=1.00). Overall, appropriateness of use was highest by the oncology/hematology service (91%) and lowest by surgery (45%) (p&#x0003c;0.001). Compliance with indications among the services did not significantly change from 2005 to 2006, but positive trends were seen in surgery, 38% to 53% (p=0.23) and critical care, 60% to 69% (p=0.69).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Appropriate use of ABx varied by ABx and by treating service, however conclusions are limited due to the small sample size. Only ciprofloxacin use significantly improved after the introduction of the AOF. These results may be used to target efforts to improve ABx use. Reasons for the variation in effect on the different Abx will be explored.</p>

        <p>
          <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> species are present as pathogens in most cases of cIAI, and require empiric therapy with broad spectrum antimicrobials. Pooled data from 2 cIAI trials were used to compare the clinical and microbiological efficacy of sequential IV/PO moxifloxacin (MXF) with comparator (COMP) therapy in patients with cIAI due to <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Data were pooled from 2 trials of sequential MXF (400 mg qd IV/PO) in the treatment of cIAI in hospitalized patients. COMP treatment consisted of IV piperacillin/tazobactam followed by PO amoxi-cillin/clavulanate, and IV ceftriaxone plus IV metronidazole followed by PO amoxicillin/clavulanate.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The 2 trials enrolled 1276 patients (632 MXF, 644 COMP) of which 890 were valid per protocol (429 MXF, 461 COMP). Of these patients, 319 (74.4%) MXF and 346 (75.1%) COMP-treated subjects were also microbiologically valid. Of these, 240 (75.2%) MXF and 253 (73.1%) COMP-treated subjects had <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> isolated from their infection sites or from blood cultures. The following organisms were isolated (MXF, COMP): <italic>E. coli</italic> (220, 223), <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp. (37, 53), <italic>Proteus</italic> spp. (17, 15), <italic>Morganella morganii</italic> (0, 3), <italic>Providencia rettgeri</italic> (3, 0), <italic>Serratia</italic> spp. (3, 3) and <italic>Enterobacter</italic> spp. (12, 15). The overall clinical and bacteriological success rates at test-of-cure among per protocol valid patients who had a positive skin culture for <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> were 187/240 (77.9%) and 186/240 (77.5%) for MXF and 200/253 (79.0%) and 206/253 (81.4%) for COMP-treated patients.</p>

        <p>Clinical Laboratories Standards Institute (CLSI) M24-A document describes a broth microdilution method for susceptibility testing of mycobacteria and aerobic actinomycetes, including <italic>Nocardia</italic>. However, the recommended reference strains for quality control include <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> but not actinomycetes. We describe a prospective analysis of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of indicated antimicrobials against a reference strain of <italic>N asteroides</italic> to facilitate more accurate interpretation of the CLSI test method.</p>

        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A McFarland standard suspension (0.5) of <italic>N asteroides</italic> ATCC 19247 cultured in Mueller Hinton (MH) broth was plated onto a MH agar plate for confluent growth. E-test&#x000ae; strips for CLSI-indicated antibiotics were placed on the plates, which were incubated at 35&#x000b0;C for 48 hr before recording the MICs.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Over a 6 year period <italic>N asteroides</italic> ATCC 19247 susceptibility testing was performed over 80 times for six of the study antibiotics. The median (minimium/maximum) MIC values (&#x003bc;g/ml) for amikacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, imipenem, minocycline, and TMP-SMX were 0.12 (0.06/2), 8 (4/16), 4 (0.12/32), 0.25 (0.12/32), 0.12 (0.03/2), and 0.12 (0.03/2), respectively. Ciprofloxacin was tested 22 times with a median MIC of 32 &#x003bc;g/ml (minimum/maximum; 8/32). By removing no more than 3 of the most extreme MIC values from each antibiotic (&#x0003c; 5% of results), the MIC range decreased by &#x02265; 2 doubling dilutions for amikacin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and TMP-SMX, 1 dilution for minocy-cline, and 0 dilutions for amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin. The adjusted ranges were &#x02264; 3 doubling dilutions for all but ceftriaxone (6) and minocycline (5).</p>

        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>This study provides good preliminary data for the use of <italic>N asteroides</italic> ATCC 19247 as a quality control strain for aerobic actino-mycetes susceptibility testing and the development of CLSI-approved MIC ranges for appropriate antibiotics. Although CLSI recommends broth microdilution for susceptibility testing, the E-test&#x000ae;-derived MIC values for this control strain were within acceptable ranges for test antibiotics, and arguably more representative of aerobic actinomycetes than quality control strains of <italic>S aureus</italic> and <italic>E coli</italic>.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Fusidic acid is a naturally occurring potent anti-staphylococcal agent that has been used for decades in Europe and Asia for the treatment of mild or severe infections caused by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (SA) although clinical use in Canada and the US has been limited. With the increased incidence and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in SA to first line agents, renewed interest in the clinical use of fusidic acid has emerged. We describe our analysis of fusidic acid susceptibility patterns of over 1500 clinical isolates of SA in a regional healthcare system.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A total of 1549 randomly selected non-duplicate clinical isolates of SA, including 567 methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) and 982 methicillin-sensitive SA (MSSA) strains recovered from Calgary Health Region patients during the year 2006 year were analyzed. Methicillin resistance was confirmed by an in-house duplex PCR for <italic>mecA</italic> and <italic>nuc</italic> genes. Fusidic acid susceptibility testing was performed using Etest, with results interpreted based on British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) guidelines (susceptible: &#x02264; 1 &#x003bc;g/ml; resistant: &#x02265;2 &#x003bc;g/ml). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using a nationally standardized protocol was performed on MRSA isolates to determine clonality.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Of the 1549 strains tested, 59 (3.8%) were resistant to fusidic acid, with resistance rates in MRSA and MSSA of 3.4% (19/566) and 4.1% (41/982), respectively. For MRSA strains, low-level (plasmidic, <italic>fusB</italic>-mediated) fusidic acid resistance (MIC &#x02265; 2 &#x003bc;g/ml and &#x02264; 8 &#x003bc;g/ml) was observed almost exclusively in community-associated MRSA clones, particularly CMRSA10 while high-level (chromosomal, <italic>fusA</italic>-mediated) resistance was observed mainly in typical hospital-associated MRSA clones. For MRSA and MSSA, the MIC<sub>90</sub> of fusidic acid was &#x02264; 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Compared to other anti-staphylococcal agents, fusidic acid resistance rates are low in our healthcare region, making it a potential useful agent for the treatment of mild to serious infections. Nevertheless, prudent use of this antimicrobial is necessary to prevent further resistance. Our observations suggest potentially unique genetic mechanisms of fusidic acid resistance based on clonal type.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Early detection of pharyngitis due to <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> using rapid Group A streptococcal antigen detection tests may reduce inappropriate antibiotic use. Performance of commercially available test kits may vary considerably. Our objective was to evaluate the performance characteristics of the QuickVue+ Strep A Test Kit (Quidel Corporation; San Diego, CA) since the only published literature on this kit had included only 213 clinical samples.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>We included pharyngeal swabs taken between July and October, 2006 from 1088 children (&#x0003c;16 yrs) with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis. Each swab was initially inoculated onto the surface of a sheep blood agar plate. Antigen testing was then performed and interpreted according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. Plates were incubated anaerobically at 35&#x000b0;C and examined at 24 and 48 hours, suspicious colonies were Gram stained and tested for the presence of pyrrolidonyl pepdidase (PYR) as per manufacturers instructions.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>
          <italic>S pyogenes</italic> was recovered from 218 (20%) patients. The QuickVue+ test detected <italic>S pyogenes</italic> antigens in 169 of the specimens which were culture positive. The test was negative in 860 of 870 specimens from which cultures were negative. Antigen testing was falsely negative in 49. Specificity was 98.9% while sensitivity was found to be 77.5%. The positive and negative predictive values for the QuickVue+ test were 94.4% and 94.6% respectively. The overall agreement between QuickVue+ and culture was 95.5%.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The QuickVue+ test is a useful screening tool for diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. The sensitivity was significantly lower than that suggested in the product monograph (95%) and suggests that in this patient population negative antigen tests should be followed by conventional culture. In an adult population in which the incidence of GAS is lower the NPV of the QuickVue+ may obviate the need for back-up culture.</p>

        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>19 medical centres across Canada submitted up to 300 isolates from ICU patients. MICs were assessed using CLSI (2006) dilution methods.</p>

        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>In total, 4180 isolates were collected (59.3% from males) with an age breakdown of 39.6% (&#x02265;65yrs), 46.7% (18&#x02013;64yrs) and 13.7% (&#x02264;17yrs). 54.8% were from respiratory; 17.7%, 13.6%, 13.9% from blood, urine, and tissue/wound specimens, respectively.

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Urines are the highest volume sample processed in Microbiology labs. The rate of detection of significant uropathogens is approximately 10&#x02013;20%. The aim of this study was to evaluate our rates of &#x0201c;possible contamination&#x0201d; and perform a &#x0201c;root-cause&#x0201d; analysis to determine if alternative collection/transport methods would be useful.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Results for 100 Urine cultures from each of 5 sites were retrospectively reviewed to determine how often we detected significant uropathogens versus possible contaminants. The data from these community healthcare facilities was compared to that for urines collected on site. The UriSwab method for collection of mid-stream urine (sponge impregnated with boric acid) was prospectively compared to routine mid-stream urine collection in a sterile container for 150 patients. Healthcare providers were also asked to indicate the relative ease of specimen collection by the two methods and provide feedback on patient satisfaction with these two methods.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Retrospective analysis showed that &#x0223c; 42% of urines from other sites had growth that was not significant. This was 5 to 7 times higher compared to on-site collected urines. This resulted in a significant amount of unnecessary work for the lab staff. Discussion with the Infection Control revealed that overgrowth during non-refrigerated transport may be an issue, but more importantly problem with collection of mid-stream urine from obese or elderly patients was identified as a significant contributor to risk of contamination. The UriSwab Urine collection method was initiated and data prospectively collected to determine if this reduced workup due to non-significant organisms. Patients having mid-stream urine were asked to comment on the two collection methods (routine MSU in a urine container vs UriSwab).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The UriSwab method for collection of mid-stream urine provided a more effective way to collect mid-stream urine in difficult to collect elderly patients. Furthermore, it was perceived as a more &#x0201c;dignified&#x0201d; collection method by elderly patients.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To evaluate a quantitative test method to determine the diffusible antimicrobial activity in 8 textile products coated with a variety of compounds with presumed antimicrobial effect.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>8 test fabrics and 2 corresponding controls were tested for antimicrobial activity against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 29213, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 33591, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> ATCC 29212, <italic>Candida parapsilosus</italic> ATCC 22019 and <italic>Issatchenkia orientalis</italic> (<italic>Candida kru-sei</italic>) ATCC 6258. Fabric with no treatment served as a control. A 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>CFU/mL bacterial suspension of each test organism was made in sterile saline. Each fabric was cut into 2&#x000d7;2 cm squares using aseptic technique. 1 mL of the bacterial suspension was placed into Petri dish along with one piece of the fabric. The solution was allowed to interact with the fabrics for 0, 1 and 10 min. After the allotted time period, the fabric was removed and placed onto a blood agar plate (BAP) and allowed to remain for 5 s so that the solution is transferred to the BAP. The fabric was then discarded. The culture medium was then incubated for 16 &#x02013; 18 h at 35&#x000b0;C in ambient air. The number of colonies present were counted where the fabric with the organism had been placed.</p>

        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Colony counts for control fabrics were greater than 100 colonies for all strains tested at 0, 1 and 10 min. Two of the fabrics tested showed complete inhibition of bacterial growth at 10 min for all organisms tested except <italic>E faecalis</italic>. Two of the fabrics inhibited <italic>S aureus</italic> 33591, <italic>C parapsilosus</italic> ATCC 22019 and <italic>I orientalis</italic> ATCC 6258 at 10 min. Two of the fabrics showed only a slight decrease in colony counts (60 &#x02013; 90 colonies) for all organisms tested and one showed only a slight decrease for <italic>S aureus</italic> ATCC 29213. One of the fabrics completely inhibited growth of all strains tested for all times except at time zero using <italic>S aureus</italic> ATCC 29213.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The purpose of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of the BD Phoenix&#x000ae; system in the detection of ESBL-producing organisms using the CLSI-recommended confirmatory disk tests and a Reference Laboratory result as the reference standards.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>BD Phoenix&#x000ae; panel NMIC/ID-24 is a combination identification and breakpoint susceptibility panel. The isolates flagged by the Phoenix&#x000ae; as ESBL-producing organisms were further analysed using the confirmatory method of MASTDISCS ID*. This system is a double disc method consisting of cefpodoxime, ceftazidime and cefotaxime, each with and without clavulanic acid. A positive result from any or all of the pairs of MAST ID ESBL Detection Discs confirms ESBL production. Isolates that flagged as ESBL-positive by the Phoenix&#x000ae; which did not confirm by the MAST Discs were sent to the Public Health Laboratory for ESBL testing.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Between March 2005 and August 2006, 90 isolates were identified as ESBL positive by the Phoenix&#x000ae;. Eighty isolates were <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 8 were <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and 2 were <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca</italic>. Forty-eight (53%) were confirmed as ESBL positive by MAST testing. Forty-two (47%) did not confirm by MAST. Thirty-nine of the 42 isolates that did not confirm by MAST were sent to PHL for ESBL testing. None of these were confirmed to be Class A ESBL. Ten of 39 were reported as AmpC-type ESBL. The Phoenix&#x000ae; erroneously reported 42 of the 90 flagged isolates as ESBL (47%).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Despite previously published reports of accuracies of 89% for ESBL detection by the BD Phoenix&#x000ae; system, in our hands, the system erroneously reported organisms as ESBL producers 47% of the time. After reviewing the collected data, an algorithm was developed to determine if the organism was an ESBL producer without having to use alternate methodology such as the MAST Disc or referring the isolates to a reference laboratory. The algorithm will lessen the workload as well as decrease the amount of time when reporting an organism as an ESBL producer. The algorithm will be periodically audited by using the MAST Disc to ensure that it reliably detects ESBL producers.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND</title>
        <p>We have previously reported that only an MSSA (and not MRSA) was recovered in 24% of IMA-positive specimens. In this study we characterized these MSSA isolates and also used them to evaluate a new updated version of the IMA.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>MSSA were tested for the presence and type of SCC<italic>mec</italic>, and for the presence of <italic>mecA</italic>, <italic>mecI</italic>, <italic>mecR</italic>, <italic>ccrA1/B1</italic>, <italic>A2/B2</italic>, and <italic>A3/B3</italic> using previously published PCR assays. Four MSSA isolates were tested in pure culture at various dilutions to determine if the specificity of the IMA correlated with the amount of target present. The performance of the updated IMA was assessed by re-testing all MSSA isolates.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Of the 34 MSSA, 15 had a PFGE profiles similar to CMRSA-2, 7 to CMRSA-7 and 2 to CMRSA-1. The PFGE profiles of the remaining 10 isolates were not consistent with known CMRSA types. <italic>mecA</italic>, <italic>mecI</italic>, <italic>mecR</italic>, <italic>ccrA2/B2</italic>, <italic>A3/B3</italic> could not be identified in any of the isolates. <italic>ccrA1/B1</italic> was identified in 12 CMRSA-2 isolates. For MSSA isolates with a CMRSA PFGE type, the SCC<italic>mec</italic> was identified as type I (11 CMRSA-2), type II (2 CMRSA-2, 7 CMRSA-7), type IVc (1 CMRSA-2) and type II/III (2 CMRSA-1). For non-CMRSA types, the SCC<italic>mec</italic> was identified as type II/III (8), type II (1) and type II/IV (1). Dilution experiments suggested that specificity of the assay was inversely proportional to the amount of target present for non-CMRSA type MSSA. With the new updated IMA version, all isolates with a CMRSA PFGE type remained positive compared to none of the non-CMRSA isolates.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>False-positive PCR results are due to MSSA isolates harboring an SCC<italic>mec</italic> element with a deletion in the <italic>mec</italic> gene complex. The new version of the IMA assay eliminated 33% of the IMA positive MSSA isolates and improved the positive predictive value of the assay. However, in our relatively low prevalence setting, IMA-positive specimens still need to be cultured to confirm the presence of MRSA.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections that results in physician office visits. Empiric therapy is generally prescribed for uncomplicated UTI. However, should therapy fail, rapid turn-around time for bacterial identification and susceptibility testing is required to guide subsequent therapy. This study examines the feasibility and accuracy of bacterial identification and susceptibility testing directly from a urine dipslide in comparison to testing after sub-culturing.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHOD</title>
        <p>Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 30 Gram-negative bacilli directly from our routine urine dipslide (Starplex DIP N COUNT&#x02122;), and by the Vitek 2 &#x02013;Compact&#x02122; (bioMerieux) system. The bacterial strains were sub-cultured and subsequently retested by BD Phoenix&#x02122;. Antimicrobial discrepancies between the direct and sub-cultured strains were resolved by standard Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility tests.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>All identifications agreed in this study. For susceptibility testing, direct tests and tests from subcultured strains agreed for the following: <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (2), <italic>Citrobacter koseri</italic> (1), <italic>Citrobacter freundii</italic> complex (1), <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (1), and <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca</italic> (1). For <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (21 strains) there were 10 minor and 3 major errors by direct testing and 8 minor errors and 1 major error when tested after subculturing. For <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> (2 strains) there were 2 minor errors by direct testing and 1 minor error when tested after sub-culturing. <italic>Hafnia alvei</italic> (1 strain) had 1 minor error from the sub-culture test.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Rapid turn-around time is important in the identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial pathogens. The minor errors observed here on direct testing may be less important for UTI therapy than for other specimen types because of concentration of many antibiotics in the urine. Further testing is warranted in the interest of improved patient care.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important pathogen in neonates. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) revised guidelines in 2002 recommend screening women for GBS carriage at 35 to 37 weeks gestation by culture of a vaginorectal swab using a selective broth with subculture onto a plate. The objective of our study was to compare our current method (selective broth with subculture) with others available so as to improve the sensitivity of detection of GBS in our laboratory.</p>

        <title>METHOD</title>
        <p>Vaginorectal swabs (200) were screened for GBS using direct inoculation to 5% sheep blood and SXT (BA + SXT) (PML); swab was vortexed in 2mL of Tryptic soy broth and inoculated into Group B Selective Broth and StrepB Carrot Broth (Hardy Diagnostics). Following incubation the broths were tested with Prolex Streptococcal latex agglutination (LA) (Prolab), subcultured onto Tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep blood (BA) (PML) and onto Granada Medium (Hardy Diagnostics). Plates were examined at 24 and 48 hrs.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The sensitivity of direct plate was low. The agglutination tests direct from the Group B Strep broth improved sensitivity, but the specificity was low. Granada medium showed improved specificity compared to BA plates. Preliminary data using StrepB Carrot broth indicated both improved sensitivity and specificity. Continued testing with this media is on-going and if preliminary findings are confirmed, this media will be incorporated into our routine for GBS screening.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To compare methods of identifying bacterial isolates from clinical laboratory specimens. This study is designed to test the MIDI Sherlock MD16S2 (1500bp) database against an in-house method based on biochemical tests, GLC-CFA identifications, and 16s rRNA gene sequence GenBank BLAST results.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>58 isolates were obtained from patient samples submitted to the Saskatchewan Disease Control Laboratory (SDCL) from Nov 2003 to Sept 2006. Conventional biochemical tests were performed on all isolates. Sequence data were compared to the NCBI GenBank database by BLAST search. GLC-CFA analyses were conducted on each isolate. All three sources of data were taken into consideration when producing the final SDCL identification. Sequence data were entered into the MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System, the SmartGene Database and the RDP Database for comparative purposes.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>When comparing to the SDCL results, the Sherlock System identified 48% isolates (28/58) to the same genus. When species identifications were available, the Sherlock System identified 43% isolates (20/46) to the same species. For eight comparisons, the Sherlock System gave identifications that were completely inconsistent with SDCL results. For example, all other methods identified one isolate as <italic>Neisseria</italic>, whereas the Sherlock System identified it as <italic>Clostridium</italic>. The SmartGene Database identified 91% isolates (52/58) to the same genus and 83% (38/46) to the same species as SDCL. The RDP Database identified 90% isolates (51/58) to the same genus and 80% (37/46) to the same species as SDCL.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>16S rDNA sequencing cannot stand alone for the identification of bacterial isolates. The Sherlock System performed the poorest of the databases examined. However, we have concluded that there is no ideal database; the best identification method requires interpretation of a combination of biochemical test results, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and GLC-CFA results by a trained microbiologist.</p>

        <p>The Roche Cobas Amplicor (RCA) PCR test for <italic>N. gon-orrhoeae</italic> (NG) has been reported to give false positive results which is of particular concern in a low prevalence population. The objective of this study was to compare NG culture with the RCA test using a 16S rRNA PCR confirmatory test. Sensitivity (sens), specificity (spec), positive predictive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined in our patient population.</p>

      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>All cervical and male urine specimens received for the <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> PCR test were tested by the NG PCR test if we also received a specimen for NG culture from the same patient on the same day. A total of 2315 male urines and 5540 cervical specimens were tested over a period of 6 months. Specimens that were positive for the RCA NG PCR test were confirmed using the 16S rRNA test by Light Cycler. Discordant PCR tests with negative culture were confirmed using 16S sequencing. A patient was considered a &#x0201c;true positive&#x0201d; if the culture was positive or if the confirmed PCR test and 16S sequencing results were positive.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>100% specificity and PPV was obtained by confirmed PCR protocol. Five of 7 cases that were missed by PCR testing and detected by culture were from symptomatic males. Therefore continued culturing for symptomatic cases along with PCR for all cases would increase the sensitivity and NPV for male specimens to 98.4% and 99.96% respectively. In addition, isolation of the organism allows for continued public health susceptibility surveillance program.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>In our laboratory we provide mycoplasma culture identification services for respiratory and genital specimens. However, culture is thought to lack sensitivity with a turn-around-time of several weeks. We examined a molecular approach to mycoplasma identification in order to improve our test performance.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Using a PCR-based approach, we evaluated oligonucleotide primer sets for the presumptive identification of mycoplasma species (M/U &#x02013; Hashimoto, et al, 2006), and for confirmatory identification of <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> (Mpn &#x02013; Ursi, et al, 2002) from frozen isolates and fresh clinical specimens. 12 broncho-aveolar lavages (BAL), 6 bronchial washes (BW), 1 endotracheal secretion (ETT), and 7 cerebrospinal fluids (CSF, from one patient) were tested with the two primer sets. Two BALs and 1 BW were also spiked with a positive culture as an inhibition control. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). We also compared the artus&#x000ae; <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> LC PCR Kit (Qiagen) to the Mpn primers.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The M/U primers reacted with all 21 of the freezer isolates, including 7 M hominis, 6 Ureaplasma spp, and 7 <italic>M pneumoniae</italic>, while the Mpn primers detected only the 7 <italic>M pneumoniae</italic>. Of the clinical samples, only 1/12 BAL and 7/7 CSF were positive for M/U, while only the M/U-positive BAL was detected with the Mpn primers. Culture confirmed the identification of the positive BAL specimen as <italic>M pneumoniae</italic>, and the CSF as M hominis; all other clinical specimens were negative by PCR and culture. <italic>M pneumoniae</italic>-spiked control specimens (3) were detected using M/U and Mpn primers. The artus&#x000ae; <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> LC PCR Kit was 100% concordant with the combined M/U and Mpn results for the 21 freezer isolates.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>This study provides preliminary evidence that PCR with characterized primer sets is as sensitive as mycoplasma culture methods but reduces the result turn-around time in the clinical setting from several weeks to several days. Further study will evaluate DNA probe detection of PCR products on a real-time PCR platform (Ursi et al, 2002).</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The recovery of potential pathogens from swabs used to collect clinical specimens is of critical importance in the laboratory diagnosis of infections. It is estimated that only 10&#x02013;15% of the organisms collected on traditional swabs, composed of spun fibres, can be recovered from cultures. Nylon flocked swabs, composed of open nylon fibres, potentially release a much higher percentage of trapped organisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of Nylon flocked swabs compared to standard spun Dacron swabs for recovery of bacteria from mocked specimens.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Nylon flocked ESwabs in liquid Amies transport medium were compared to spun Dacron swabs in Amies agar gel transport medium. Serial dilutions of <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> were prepared in 0.85% saline. 100ul aliquots of the suspensions were transferred to microtitre plates, and swabs were inoculated by dipping them in the wells of the microtitre plates. Each inoculated swab was placed into transport medium and either cultured immediately or after storage for 24 or 48h at room temperature or 4C. All testing was done in triplicate.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The recovery of Neisseria <italic>gonorrhoeae</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> from ESwabs was equivalent or superior to the recovery from Dacron swabs at room temperature and 4C at both 24 and 48h. Recovery of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> from ESwabs compared to Dacron swabs was variable.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Nylon flocked ESwabs in liquid Amies transport medium are at least equivalent to traditional Dacron swabs in Amies agar gel transport medium for recovery of bacteria commonly found in clinical specimens. The liquid transport medium used with the nylon flocked swabs provides a suspension of sample material that offers potential advantages for inoculation of multiple media and slides.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>
          <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> is a highly virulent pathogen that has been recognized as one of the category A biothreat bacterial agents. Therefore there is a requirement in Canada for a rapid and accurate technique capable of detecting this selected agent. The objective of this research was to develop a specific, ultra-sensitive, multi-target, multiplexed real time poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) for the reliable detection of <italic>Y pestis</italic> in environmental or clinical samples. This assay simultaneously detects regions on pPCP1 and pMT1 virulence plasmids as well as chromosomal target that are specific for <italic>Y pestis</italic> strains.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHOD</title>
        <p>DNA from <italic>Y pestis</italic> and related genera was extracted using Qiagen DNA kit. Multiplex PCR was based on Taqman 5&#x02032; nuclease design and performed on a Cepheid SmartCycler II platform. Gene sequences were obtained from GenBank. The target regions were plasminogen activator (<italic>pla</italic>), F1 capsule antigen (<italic>caf1</italic>) and YPO2084 signature gene. Optimised primers and probes were selected using Primer Express Software. Specificity was tested against numerous strains of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> and against a panel of related organisms. Serial dilutions of <italic>Y pestis</italic> DNA were used for evaluation of sensitivity.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULT</title>
        <p>Applying this multiplexed assay, <italic>Y pestis</italic> was selectively identified; other bacteria yielded no amplification curve. Related pathogenic <italic>Yersinia</italic> species and other enterobacteriaceae having antigens common to <italic>Y pestis</italic> were not detected. The lower limit of this assay was 10 genome equivalents per reaction. Also, since this multiplex assay targets key virulence factors this allowed the detection of prominent virulence markers of <italic>Y pestis</italic> strains. Known strains lacking virulence plasmids were correctly identified and differentiated.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Our multiplexed 5&#x02032; nuclease assay is sensitive, specific and allows differentiation of <italic>Y pestis</italic> strains leading to fast and reliable investigation results more quickly that with other traditional techniques. It requires minimal sample input and can yield results in approximately 3 hrs. Since the detection and virulence assessment occurs in one reaction, this assay in cost effective and has been selected as one of the primary plague identification platforms by the newly created Canadian Laboratory Response Network. results in approximately 3 hrs.

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The gastrointestinal pathogen, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, is the etiological agent of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers, and a major risk factor for gastric cancer. Its increasing resistance to several antimicrobial agents, particularly Clarithromycin, is a public health concern. The objective of this study was to evaluate a real-time PCR method for <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> detection and Clarithromycin resistance profiles characterization.</p>

      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>
          <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> DNA were extracted from previous samples using Qiagen Tissue Kit. The Roche LightCycler 2.0 instrument and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes were used for the real-time PCR. This test targeted the three point mutations in two positions on the <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> 23S rRNA. Melting curve analysis was used for the differentiation of wild type and mutant strains. The amplicons were also sequenced to further evaluate the melting curve analysis results. To view the biological profile of Clarithromycin resistance, the E-test was performed and results compared.

All samples simultaneously were found to have <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> and their resistance profile characterized. The melting curve analysis was confirmed by their sequence results. The resistance profiles obtained from the melting curve analysis were also in agreement with the E-test profiles.</p>
      </sec>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>This real-time PCR is faster than the traditional E-test in detecting Clarithromycin resistant <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>. The sensitivity and specificity indicate that this method may be an efficient tool to aid physicians in obtaining resistance profiles without delaying patient treatment. Further study is ongoing.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND</title>
        <p>Moxifloxacin (MXF) has proven efficacy for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI). Most cIAI infections are polymicrobial and often include anaerobic bacteria. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of MXF when anaerobic bacteria were found in clinical specimens.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Pooled data from 2 cIAI trials examining sequential intravenous to oral (IV/PO) MXF (400 mg once daily) were analyzed. Comparator treatment in one study was IV piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) (3.0/0.375 g every 6 hr) followed by oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC) (800/114 mg twice daily) and in the other study was IV ceftriax-one (CTX) (2 g once daily) and metronidazole (MTZ) (500 mg three times daily) followed by oral AMC (500/125 mg three times daily). Clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication (eradication and presumed eradication) rates were assessed at the test-of-cure visit.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The MXF MIC<sub>50/90</sub> for the key anaerobic pathogens (n=205) was 1/2 &#x003bc;g/mL. Combined cure rates for patients valid for efficacy were 80.4% (345/429) for MXF- and 80.4% (371/461) for comparator-treated patients. The Table shows clinical success rates and bacteriological eradication rates for MXF- and comparator-treated patients from the 2 trials for select anaerobic pathogens (n=139).</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>CAL serogroup viruses are second only to West Nile virus (WNV) in causing arbovirus-associated illness in North America. Human disease due to infection with snowshoe hare (SSH) and Jamestown Canyon (JC) CAL serogroup viruses has been recognized previously in Canada. The objective of this study was to develop serological assays for the surveillance and identification of human infections in Canada due to these viruses.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Cultures of SSH and JC viral strains isolated from mosquito homogenates and rodent blood samples were propagated in Vero cells. Viral antigens were prepared from suckling mouse brain suspensions and concentrated tissue culture preparations and used in immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Plaque reduction neutralization assays (PRNT) were undertaken on ELISA positive serum samples to confirm the presence of CAL serogroup specific antibody and to differentiate between SSH and JC virus exposures.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Using panels of SSH virus antibody positive sera and serum samples from confirmed cases of various arbovirus and non-arbovirus infections both IgM and IgG ELISAs exhibited appropriate sensitivity and specificity. The screening of 487 sera collected from symptomatic non-WNV infected patients during mosquito seasons from 2003 - 2006 resulted in the identification of 28 (5.7%) probable CAL serogroup exposures from across Canada. The further characterization of ELISA positive sera by PRNT documented the presence of SSH virus specific antibody and for particular cases of CAL serogroup exposure diagnostic rises in titre confirmed the association of viral infection with neurological disease.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The application of various serological platforms for the diagnosis of CAL serogroup virus infections in symptomatic patients affirms that these agents are circulating throughout Canada. Public health officials should consider these agents as part of a differential diagnosis of febrile illness and meningititis /encephalitis cases when seasonal exposure to infected mosquitoes may occur.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Polyomaviruses JC and BK infect the majority of the population but remain latent in the urinary tract and in circulating B-lymphocytes of immunocompetent hosts. In certain situations associated with immuno-suppression, these viruses can reactivate and cause severe pathology. The objective of this study was to evaluate a method to detect and accurately quantify polyomaviruses JC and BK simultaneously in human clinical samples.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Duplex PCR assays detected JCV and BKV simultaneously and targeted the viral large T antigen. Amplicons were generated using an ABI 7500 Fast thermocycler and detected with TaqMan probes coupled to the dyes FAM (BKV) and VIC (JCV). Quantification involved the use of an external standard curve consisting of a mixture of plasmid DNA containing the complete genomes of JCV and BKV. To monitor the effectiveness of the DNA extraction procedure and control for the possible inhibition of the PCR, we included a third amplicon in a triplex assay. This internal amplification control (IAC) was amplified from murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) DNA and was detected using a TaqMan probe coupled to the dye NED.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Quantification using a standard curve containing a mixture of equal amounts JC and BK plasmid DNA was as effective in duplex format as in singleplex format, with very high linearity over seven orders of magnitude and PCR efficiencies &#x0003e;1.9. In addition, the IAC was detected in samples with low or no polyomavirus genomes, making it effective for monitoring extraction efficiency and PCR inhibition. However, we found that samples containing a high level of JCV genomes and a low level of BKV genomes (&#x0003e;1000-fold excess of JCV over BKV) were falsely determined to be BKV negative. The detection of the IAC was also quenched by high levels of JCV or BKV DNA.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The simultaneous detection of JCV and BKV DNA in clinical samples is generally effective, but is limited by an inability to detect low levels of BKV in samples that also contain high levels of JCV. The IAC is similarly quenched by high levels of target viral DNA; however it still functions effectively to monitor extraction efficiency and PCR inhibition in samples that are negative for both viruses.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>In September 2000, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care directed the Quality Management Program &#x02013; Laboratory Services (QMP-LS) to develop, implement and evaluate a mandatory program of accreditation for all medical laboratories in the province.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHOD</title>
        <p>The accreditation consensus requirements were released in 2002 and a revised version with guidance, based on ISO 15189:2003, in May 2003. The version that is currently in use was issued in September 2005. With each biennial review of the requirements, input is sought from scientific experts and participating laboratories. Accreditation assessment began in 2003 and consists of two parts: a laboratory self-assessment and on-site peer assessment. In order to achieve accreditation, laboratories must submit corrective actions following peer assessment. QMP-LS conducts ongoing surveillance of proficiency testing in all laboratories that hold an accreditation certificate and additional surveillance activities in the event of significant changes in laboratory management and/or the scope of licensed tests. Conformance rates are monitored to identify individual requirements that may require review.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Discipline specific application of the requirements includes 36 microbiology considerations and others specific to molecular diagnostic technology. All of the requirements and the discipline specific information are referenced to published sources such as CLSI. In Ontario, there are 236 licensed laboratories, and 137 of these have a microbiology component. To date, 87 of the 137 hold accreditation certificates. In general, conformance ranges from 75 to 100% with an average of 94%.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Ontario's QMP-LS is the first North American accreditation authority to assess laboratories against ISO 15189:2003 and demonstrate that they meet this rigorous international standard.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Malaria is increasingly diagnosed in non-endemic countries and represents a potentially lethal infection particularly in children. Clinicians may be unfamiliar with this rare but serious infection which could lead to inappropriate management and delays in treatment. For these reasons a malaria management protocol was developed and implemented at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in September 1999. We retrospectively evaluated the management and outcomes of children admitted with the diagnosis of malaria 10 years pre- and 6 years post the implementation of the malaria treatment protocol.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A retrospective historic case control study included all admissions with the discharge diagnosis of malaria from January 1989 until September 2006 (10 years pre and 6 years post implementation of the protocol). Quantitative and qualitative data was obtained from each chart. Time from diagnosis of malaria to administration of appropriate antimalar-ial treatment was determined. Outcomes measured included mortality, length of hospital stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Fifty-eight admissions were identified during the defined period. 82.5% of admissions were due to falciparum malaria. The median age was 6.3 years (range 0.7, 15.7). Children were diagnosed a median of 17 days (range 1, 365) following return from the country of acquisition. Majority of the diagnoses (66.1%) occurred after the first health care visit. 31 (53.4%) cases were prior to the implementation of the protocol. There were no mortalities. Median length of stay (3 vs 2 days; p=0.981), median time to treatment initiation (7 vs 6 hours, p=0.217) and ICU admission rates (19% vs 7%, p=0.263) were not significantly different between the pre- and post-implementation time periods.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The vast majority of paediatric malaria cases seen in this study were due to falciparum malaria. A significant percentage of patients experienced a delay in diagnosis of malaria. Although broad-based implementation of an evidence-based malaria treatment protocol at tertiary care children's hospital resulted in more thorough investigation of admitted patients there was no significant difference seen in time to initiation of antimalarial treatment.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>
          <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> is the most commonly diagnosed agent of antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) in the clinical laboratory; however, <italic>C perfringens</italic> has also been recently implicated in this disease syndrome. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of <italic>C perfringens</italic> enterotoxin in stools from suspect AAD cases in which <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin was not detected.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Stool samples from hospitals, nursing homes and community physicians submitted to our public health laboratory were initially tested for <italic>C difficile</italic> A and B toxins and frozen. <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin negative stools were subsequently thawed and tested for <italic>C perfringens</italic> enterotoxin. All toxin testing was conducted using ELISA kits from TECHLAB (Blacksburg, VA) according to manufacturers instructions.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A total of 43 (8.5%) of the 505 stools previously tested negative for <italic>C difficile</italic> toxins A and B were positive for <italic>C perfringens</italic> enterotoxin. By comparison, 118 (16.2%) of 729 stool specimens submitted to our laboratory were <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin positive.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Involvement of <italic>C perfringens</italic> as a possible causative agent of AAD should be considered when <italic>C difficile</italic> toxins are not detected in a patient's stool. The use of TECHLAB ELISA kits provides a rapid and convenient means for assisting in the diagnosis of AAD involving these two agents.</p>

        <p>To compare the effectiveness of three methods for the detection of Enterohemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EHEC), by sorbitol MacConkey agar (SMAC) culture, fecal cytotoxic assay and PCR for Shiga-like Toxin genes (<italic>Stx1</italic> + <italic>Stx2</italic>)</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>All stool specimens referred over a one year period to our lab for fecal cytotoxic assay were also cultured on SMAC and subjected to <italic>Stx1</italic> + <italic>Stx2</italic> detection by PCR.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Overall, 54/858 fecal specimens were positive by one or more test methods for EHEC: 22, 65 and 94% of these specimens were positive by direct culture, fecal cytotoxic assay and <italic>Stx</italic> PCR, respectively. Broth enrichment of stool specimens increased the SMAC culture detection of EHEC positive specimens from 22 to 43%. Nineteen specimens were positive only by fecal cytotoxic assay or <italic>Stx</italic> PCR, and 35 specimens were positive by both tests. Toxin positive isolates were recovered from 86% of the specimens positive by both tests and none of the specimens positive by only one of the tests. Twenty-three percent of the toxin positive isolates were serotypes other than O157:H7.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>These results suggest that targeting only sorbitol negative isolates of <italic>E. coli</italic> in stool specimens may be inadequate for the laboratory diagnosis of EHEC infections, and other methods, such as <italic>Stx</italic> PCR or fecal cytotoxic assay should be used in addition to SMAC culture.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score (LIA, Innogenetics) test was introduced in our HIV confirmatory algorithm in February 2006. The usefulness of this test to clarify the status of patients with indeterminate results in HIV-1 Western-Blot (WB) was assessed.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>All specimens being tested with LIA were selected. If more than one sample was received for a patient, his/her status (probably non infected or infected) was established based on results of previous or follow-up samples.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Preliminary data were collected from mid-February to the end of August 2006. Of the 1932 specimens submitted for HIV confirmation, 402 (20.8%) were tested by LIA. These specimens were obtained from 313 patients. A single specimen was obtained from 156 patients; 144/156 were LIA negative; 10/156 LIA indeterminate; 1/156 LIA HIV-1 positive and 1/156 LIA HIV-2 positive. Status was established for 157 patients based on results of sequential samples submitted for HIV diagnostic. The majority (153/157) of patients were classified as probably non infected, 150 had a LIA negative results, and three (3) a LIA indeterminate result. Of the 4/157 patients classified as infected one was negative by LIA, two had an HIV-1 positive result and one an HIV-2 positive result.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>LIA correctly identified 150/153 samples of patients with a non specific reaction in WB. Patients with an HIV-2 infection could be identified using this test. Ongoing study will determine if final interpretation reported for a patient with an HIV-1 Western-Blot indeterminate result should take into account the result of LIA although the test is not licensed for diagnostic purposes in Canada.</p>

        <p>To determine the extent to which guideline-based strategies for the prevention of central venous catheter (CVC)-associated bloodstream infections are incorporated into CVC insertion practices in intensive care units (ICUs) in hospitals participating in CNISP.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A 5-page survey of practices and policies for non-tunneled CVC insertion and care (adapted from Warren et al 2006) was completed by infection control professionals, with the assistance of nurse managers and attending physicians, in 33 hospitals participating in CNISP.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Seventy-three of a possible 84 ICUs responded to the survey (83%). Formal education on CVC care is provided to nursing staff at least once/year at 26 ICUs (36%), and at 36 ICUs (49%) training is provided to nurses at orientation. Twenty-seven ICUs (37%) never provide formal training on CVC insertion to medical house staff. Twenty-five ICUs (40%) insert CVCs at a femoral site for at least 25% of CVCs. Only 43 ICUs (65%) reported using masks for all CVC insertions.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Practices of CVC insertion in ICUs vary from hospital to hospital. Canadian evidence-based guidelines for CVC insertion and care are inconsistently applied.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, but relatively innocuous. Rarely, nosocomial UTIs can be complicated by blood stream infection (BSI) &#x02013; much more serious infection that, once recognized clinically, requires urgent therapy. Our objective was to gain knowledge of prevalent pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles seen in nosocomial BSI from urinary source at our institution in order to guide empiric choice of antimicrobials. A secondary objective was to determine if the etiology of nosocomial BSI from urine source had changed compared to a previous era.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>We carried out prospective surveillance of blood culture isolates at the University of Alberta hospital, from 1999&#x02013;2005. Patient charts were reviewed to determine source of infection, in-hospital mortality, and presence of known risk factors. We then compared our findings with those from a similar surveillance study performed during 1986&#x02013;1994 at our institution.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Of 2519 episodes of nosocomial BSI, 168 (6.7%) were of urinary tract origin. Although the rate of nosocomial BSI from any source was higher during 1999&#x02013;2005 compared to 1986&#x02013;1994 (13.4 and 7.7 per 1000 hospital admissions, respectively, p&#x0003c;0.00001), the rate of nosocomial BSI from urinary source was stable at 0.9 per 1000 hospital admissions for both periods. The rate of nosocomial, urine-source BSI was higher for the Neurology/Neurosurgical service than for the medical, surgical, pediatric, and critical care services. In-hospital mortality associated with nosocomial BSI from urinary source was 24%. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with Candidemia than in patients with bacteremia (67% versus 19.6%; p=0.00026), in elderly patients than in non-elderly patients (29% and 17%, p&#x0003c;0.05), and in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients (46% and 20%, p&#x0003c;0.05). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was the most common microbial cause (37%) although <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp (21%), <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp (10%), and <italic>Candida</italic> spp (9%) were also relatively common. The proportion of urine-source BSIs due to Enterococci was significantly higher during 1999&#x02013;2005 then during 1986&#x02013;1994 (21% and 12.3%, p=0.01). Further, 15% of Enterococci in the current era were resistant to ampicillin. Quinolone resistance was 20% among <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolates and 9% among isolates from the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> family.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The rate of nosocomial BSI from urinary source at our institution is stable but the microbial etiology is changing. Empiric treatment should include coverage for ampicillin-resistant Enterococci and quinolone resistant aerobic Gram-negative bacilli including <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>The rapid detection of MRSA is essential to patient care and infection control. For the last two years, CLSI has recommended screening <italic>S aureus</italic> isolates for MRSA with either the cefoxitin (FOX) disc diffusion or oxacillin screen agar (OXA). Agar screens are preferable for rapid screening of the large number of <italic>S aureus</italic> isolated in microbiology laboratories. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare FOX screen agars to CLSI methods for the detection of MRSA.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>205 clinical and surveillance <italic>S aureus</italic> isolates were compared in a prospective, blinded manner to CLSI methods. 0.5 McFarland suspensions of isolates were spot inoculated onto the 6 &#x003bc;g/mL OXA screen and to Mueller Hinton agars containing 4, 6, 8 or 10 &#x003bc;g/mL of FOX and examined after 18&#x02013;24 h incubation at 35&#x000b0;C. The same suspensions were subjected to disc diffusion with 30 &#x003bc;g FOX discs. All MRSA isolates were confirmed by the detection of PBP2a by latex agglutination (Denka Seiken, Japan).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A total of 57 (27.8%) <italic>S aureus</italic> were identified as MRSA as per latex agglutination. All 57 were detected by OXA and 54 by FOX disc. The 3 isolates missed by FOX disc had borderline zone diameters (20&#x02013;21 mm). There were no false-positives identified by OXA or FOX disc. The FOX 4, 6, 8 and 10 agars identified 57, 57, 57, and 56 of the 57 MRSA. The 1 isolate missed by FOX 10 was observed at 18 h suggesting that a longer incubation may be superior with this concentration. The FOX 4, 6, 8 and 10 agars each identified 5, 2, 0, and 0 false positives. The false positives identified on FOX 4 and 6 were identified after 20 h incubation suggesting that a shorter incubation may be superior at these concentrations. The resulting sensitivities/specificities for each method were OXA-6 (100%/100%), FOX disk (94.7%/100%), FOX-4 (100%/96.7%), FOX-6 (100%/98.6%), FOX-8 (100%/100%) and FOX-10 (98.2%/100%).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>The use of spot screen agars is a more practical method than disc diffusion for the clinical microbiology laboratory as it is simple, rapid and cost effective. The FOX screen agars of all concentrations accurately identified the MRSA in this pilot study. However, a larger study is warranted to determine the optimal concentration and length of incubation. Interestingly, the newly recommended FOX disc test failed to identify 3 MRSA.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND</title>
        <p>There are a number of biases that may influence the validity of laboratory-based surveillance for anti-microbial resistance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential magnitude of bias in reporting of etiologic agents and their resistance rates associated with failure to exclude multiple patient samples and the timing and location of sampling.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>All significant urine cultures submitted to a large regional laboratory between 2004 and 2005 were studied. Comparisons were then made using either the overall cohort or different subgroups as compared to the &#x0201c;reference&#x0201d; or gold standard population where only one sample per patient per year was included.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Overall 56,897 organisms were cultured at &#x02265;10<sup>7</sup> cfu/L from 53,548 samples from 35,890 patients; 39,835 organisms were included in the reference cohort. Reporting of urinary tract etiology from the overall cohort resulted in an 8% underestimation of the true proportion of urinary tract infections due to the principal pathogen <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and resulted in an overestimation of up to 70% in the rate of resistance to anti-microbials commonly used to treat these infections. There were dramatic differences in both the distribution of organisms and rates of resistance associated with sampling during different times of the day, week, and year as well as from acute care and outpatient sites.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Reports from laboratory-based surveillance studies may be highly biased depending on the rigor of the methodology employed. Care must be taken in generalizing results of surveillance studies that do not protect from these major sources of bias.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>American centers have reported soldiers injured in Iraq may carry multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter. Canadian soldiers have been in Afghanistan since 2001 and recently have been engaged in offensive operations with resultant increased frequency of injury. Seriously injured soldiers are triaged on site then transferred to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany and ultimately to Canada. The objective of our research was to determine whether Canadians injured in Afghanistan and admitted to our hospital have been found to be infected or colonized with MDR Acinetobacter.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Consecutive soldiers admitted to our hospital for treatment of injuries acquired in Afghanistan between 01/01/06 and 15/08/06 were reviewed. Soldiers were screened for the presence of MDR Acinetobacter or other resistant organisms on admission. Contact isolation was applied until screening results were available.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>12 patients were admitted between Jan &#x02018;06 and Aug &#x02018;06; 6 were infected (4) or colonized (2) with Acinetobacter (skin/wound = 2, sputum/tracheal secretions = 2, nares = 1). Isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, cephalosporins, variably susceptible to carbapenems and aminoglycosides. All were colistin susceptible. No secondary transmission to other hospital patients occurred. Identified co-pathogens included MRSA, <italic>Serratia</italic> spp, <italic>Enterobacter</italic> spp, <italic>Stenotrophomas</italic> spp, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp, and ESBL producing <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp and <italic>E. coli</italic> in 1 or more cases.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Canadian soldiers injured in Afghanistan admitted to our hospital have a very high frequency of carriage of MDR Acinetobacter and other MDR pathogens, justifying microbial screening and isolation practices on admission.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Hospital acquired (nosocomial) infections are the commonest serious complication of health care delivery. Bloodstream infections (BSI) are especially serious, and, since they are readily detectable, are useful for assessing long term trends in infection rates. Previous studies in our hospitals in the 1990's revealed a marked increase in BSI rates associated with a measurable increase in patient acuity during a period of province wide healthcare restructuring. The objective of this study was to assess trends in BSI since the end of the restructuring era (1999&#x02013;2005).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Prospective surveillance for BSI has been performed in our facilities for over a decade. Surveillance is both lab based and clinically based, where all admitted patients with positive blood cultures are diagnosed with a BSI based on criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Infection Control database was reviewed for BSI cases between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2005. Available measures of patient volumes, acuity and BSI risk factors between 1999 and 2005 were also reviewed from available hospital records.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>There has been a steady decline in the number and rate of BSI since 1999, and the overall 2005 BSI rate was 32.7% below the 1999 rate. The downward trend was widespread &#x02013; involving both adult and pediatric populations. Primary BSI, largely occurring as a complication of intravas-cular therapy, decreased by 39.7% between 1999 and 2005, and secondary BSI decreased by 19.9%. Over the same time period, there was a 54.1% increase in central venous catheter (CVC) line days in the 7 ICU's. The number of hospital-wide admissions (15.4%), ICU admissions (5.5%), hospital-wide patient days (18.6%), ICU patient days (10.5%), total parenteral nutrition days (3.0%), and number of solid organ transplants (48.6%) remained either unchanged or increased over the 6 years study period. The etiology of BSI varied over time - gram positive bacterial causes of BSI declined in number and rate but gram negative bacterial and fungal etiologies were unchanged.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>From 1999 through 2005 there was a continuous downward trend in hospital acquired BSI at University of Alberta and Stollery Children's Hospitals. Patient volume, measurable acuity, and risk factors for primary BSI were either unchanged or increased between 1999 and 2005. Therefore, patient population changes are unlikely to account for declines in BSI. Improved care of catheter lines may account for some part of the observed BSI trend (ie, primary BSI). The data imply that, over time, hospitals can gradually adjust to changing patient care circumstances and, in this example, control infectious complications of health care delivery.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>A measles vaccine has been licensed for use in Canada since the 1960s and there is a pan-American initiative to eliminate measles from the Americas. Enhanced surveillance, which includes the case-by-case laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases, is important for monitoring the status of measles in Canada. The elimination of endemic measles was documented in Canada in 2004. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for measles is important for both diagnostic and molecular epidemiological purposes. The objective of this study was to fully validate a sensitive, specific and rapid RT-PCR method for measles diagnostics.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Two real-time TaqMan probe based RT-PCR assays for the detection of measles virus RNA in clinical specimens were selected from the literature for evaluation in addition to our RT-PCR method used for genotyping purposes. Dilution series of synthetic hemagglutinin (H) and nucleoprotein (N) gene RNA were tested a minimum of 21 times with all three RT-PCR methods to determine their detection limits, reproducibility and repeatability. In addition, a panel consisting of clinical specimens and isolates (n = 65) that had been previously tested with another PCR method (27 negative and 38 positive) were tested.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The detection limit, as defined as the minimum number of target copies that produce a positive result in 95% of test runs, was found to be 100 copies of synthetic RNA per reaction for the two real-time RT-PCR assays and the genotyping RT-PCR assay. The detection limit concentration (100 copies for all three) was positive every time that it was tested (minimum of 7 separate runs of triplicates) resulting in reproducibility and repeatability estimates of &#x0003e;95%. Finally, the panel of 65 samples tested with these RT-PCR methods yielded the expected results for all samples. The sensitivity and specificity are therefore estimated to be &#x0003e;95%.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The two real-time RT-PCR assays for measles proved to be rapid, analytically sensitive, reproducible and have high specificity and sensitivity. The use of two different target genes (H and N) is desirable to avoid false negatives due to potential viral mutations.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Surveillance for invasive <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> was initiated in the province of Qu&#x000e9;bec prior to the introduction of the vaccination programs (adults in 2000 and, children less than 5 years old in December 2004 with catch up) and pursued thereafter to monitor the sero-type distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of invasive pneumococcal isolates.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>All cases of invasive <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> infections were reported monthly to the reference laboratory (LSPQ) by hospital laboratories. In addition, sentinel laboratories submitted all their invasive isolates for serotyping (capsular staining) and susceptibility testing according to CLSI methods.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>From 1996 to 2005, 11,632 cases were identified for an incidence rate of 15.7/100 000 population (range 13.8 to 17.3). A total of 4,447 strains were tested: 31.2% isolated from adults &#x02264; 65 years of age and 28.5% from children &#x0003c; 5 years of age. The proportion of serotypes included in the 23-valent vaccine and recovered among adults &#x02264; 65 years decreased from 90.4% in 1996 to 75.4% in 2005; those included in the conjugated 7-valent vaccine and isolated in children &#x0003c; 5 years decreased from 91.3% in 1996 to 52.5% in 2005. Since the introduction of the vaccination program for children, serotype 3 has replaced serotype 14 as the most prevalent type in the global serotype distribution. Reduced susceptibility to penicillin was found in 15% of the isolates (range 9.8% to 19.7%) of which 6.2% and 8.8% exhibited intermediate and high level resistance respectively. A higher prevalence of erythromycin resistance was observed over the years (4.9% to 26.3%) as well as for clindamycin (12% to 16.2%). Most isolates (&#x0003e; 96%) remain susceptible to a quinolone and all were susceptible to vancomycin.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>The introduction of the vaccination programs for <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>, particularly in children, have had an impact on serotype distribution and associated penicillin susceptibility patterns. More surveillance is needed to further characterize the evolution of patterns.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>A vaccination program for children &#x0003c; 5 years old, using 3 doses of the protein- conjugated heptavalent vaccine for infants and a catch-up for children up to 5 years, was initiated in December 2004 in the province of Qu&#x000e9;bec. Surveillance among the children population was added to the existing surveillance in order to assess the impact of the new vaccination program.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A surveillance program on-going since 1996 studied all invasive <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> strains isolated in sentinel laboratories. Since January 2005, all invasive strains isolated from children &#x0003c; 5 years old were also requested from all laboratories. Strains were serotyped (capsular staining) and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by a microdilution method according to CLSI method. Erythromycin resistant isolates were analyzed by PCR.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>From January 1st 2005 to 30th June 2006, 161 cases of invasive infection were reported among children &#x0003c; 5 years with incidence rates of 31.4/100 000 in 2005 and 24.4 in 2006. Within these cases, 155 strains were received at the LSPQ and had been isolated from blood (91.6%), CSF (7.1%), and other sterile sites (1.3%). When comparing with 2004 sentinel laboratories data, we observed a decrease of 56.6% of cases in 2005 and 66% in 2006. Strain serotypes were related to those included in the 7-V vaccine for 58.8% of cases during 2005 and 36.6% during 2006. Mean resistance rates were: PEN (12.3%: 14.9% in 2005, 4.9% in 2006), CEF (non meningitidis) (0.7%), CHL (12.3%: 14.9% in 2005, 4.9% in 2006), CLIN (27.1%), ERY (38.7%: 40% in 2005, 34% in 2006), TMP-SMX (15.5%: 16.7% in 2005, 12.2% in 2006). No strain was resistant to CEF (meningitidis), LEV or VAN. Erythromycin resistance genes found were: <italic>erm</italic>(B): 41, <italic>mef</italic>(A): 17, both genes: 1, none: 1.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>The implementation of the new vaccination program for children less than 5 years old has had a positive impact on the infection rate. Changes in serotype distribution and susceptibility profiles were also observed. More surveillance is needed to further characterize the evolution of patterns.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The prevalence of macrolide-resistant Group A Streptococcus (GAS) have been reported to be increasing in Canada. However, reports tend to focus on surveillance performed outside British Columbia, and describe data predominantly from non-invasive isolates. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate and characteristics of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance from isolates collected from blood and sterile body sites at Providence Health Care over the last three years.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>From January 2004 to November 2006, a total of 90 clinical isolates from blood and sterile body sites were collected from adult patients. Susceptibility testing was performed using Kirby-Bauer methodology, and erythromycin and clindamycin resistance phenotypes were determined by double-disk diffusion (&#x0201c;D-test&#x0201d;). A subset of the isolates (n=55) was characterized by their M-type virulence factor, either serologically or genotypically, at a reference laboratory.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Overall, 24 (26.7%) of the isolates were resistant to erythro-mycin. The resistance rates in 2004, 2005 and 2006 were 34.4%, 22.2% and 22.6%, respectively. Of the 24 resistant isolates, one (1.1%) was intrinsically resistant to clindamycin (<italic>erm</italic>B phenotype), while the remaining 23 had an inducible resistance to clindamycin (<italic>erm</italic>A phenotype). No <italic>mef</italic>A phenotypes were detected. 13 of the 55 isolates characterized by their M-types had the <italic>erm</italic>A phenotype. These were found to belong in one of two different M-types: <italic>emm</italic>91 (46.1%) or <italic>emm</italic>PT2976 (46.1%).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>These data demonstrate unexpectedly high rates of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance in GAS isolates recovered at a large, urban hospital in Vancouver. Rates appear stable for 2005 and 2006. Geographical differences of macrolide resistance rates in GAS appear to exist across Canada. High rates of resistance found in this study are concerning and suggest the need for continued surveillance and routine eryth-romycin and clindamycin susceptibility testing in GAS.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>In order to evaluate the laboratory epidemiology of <italic>H influenzae</italic> infections in the post Hib vaccination era, a surveillance system was instituted to follow the incidence of invasive <italic>H influenzae</italic> infections and their associated biotypes and serotypes.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Starting in 1997, all invasive strains of Hi isolated in Qu&#x000e9;bec laboratories were sent to the Laboratoire de sant&#x000e9; publique du Qu&#x000e9;bec (LSPQ). Identities of all isolates were reconfirmed and biotypes determined according to current nomenclature. From 1997 to 1999, serotyping was performed by slide agglutination; thereafter, capsular types were determined by PCR. A computational analysis was made to assess the evolution of Hi infection.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The number of invasive Hi strains isolated each year remained relatively stable (60&#x02013;70 strains) over the decade. Of the 589 isolates tested (80% blood, 5% cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)), 13 (2.2%) belonged to serotype a, 75 (12.7%) to serotype b, 9 (1.5%) to serotype e, 58 (9.8%) to serotype f and 434 (73.7%) strains were non-encapsulated; 53% of CSF isolates were nontypable. The proportion of type b strains remained relatively stable over the years. There were no type c and d strains recovered. Biotype II (249) isolates were the most frequent followed by biotype I (150), III (108), IV (26), V (20), VI (5) and VII (2). Most (86%) of the encapsulated isolates belonged to biotype I. Sixty one percent (353) of invasive infections occurred in adults &#x0003e;40 and particularly in those over 70 (182). However, Hib caused &#x0003c;2% of infections in any age class.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Most invasive Hi infections were caused by non-encapsulated strains, hence not preventable by the current vaccine. As expected, the proportion of Hib isolates was low in children. Type a and e isolates were infrequent. Invasive Hi infections were mostly encountered in adults with 74% of cases ages &#x0003e;20. These observations suggest that Hi invasive infections are becoming more of an adult problem in Qu&#x000e9;bec.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Hantaviruses are members of the family <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> and are rodent-borne viruses with worldwide distribution. In Canada, Sin Nombre virus (SNV) is maintained by deer mice, <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic>. Serosurveys of deer mouse populations have been conducted following cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Due to the difficulty in obtaining recombinant SNV antigen for ELISA testing, alternate sources of antigen were evaluated.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>ELISA testing was performed on a blind panel of 113 field-collected mouse sera using an adaptation of a commercial ELISA for human diagnostics as well as an in-house ELISA using cell-culture derived Black Creek Canal virus (BCC). The results and sensitivities of the assays were compared to those obtained using recombinant SNV antigen provided by CDC.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The modification of the commercial kit allowed detection of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> IgG antibodies to SNV in 100% (61/61) of the sera previously determined to be positive using the recombinant antigen from CDC. Due to the different cut-off value established for the commercial kit, 92.3% (12/13) of the samples considered equivocal with the recombinant antigen were positive by the commercial assay. Of the 39 negative samples tested, 94.9% (37/39) were also negative by the commercial kit. Overall, there was reduced sensitivity when the BCC was used, necessitating a reduction in the cut-off value. Once implemented, 95.1% of the positives, 84.6% of the equivocals, and 100% of the negatives were detected using BCC.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The commercial kit provides excellent correlation to the CDC method however, its high cost limits its use in high-volume screening of field-collected rodents. Although BCC antigen is inexpensive and relatively easy to produce, reduced sensitivity makes it an unacceptable alternative to the recombinant SNV antigen from the CDC.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>To analyze the West Nile virus (WNV) antibody (Ab) and nucleic acid (NA) testing data captured in the last 4 years and to study the factors influencing laboratory identification of WNV human infections in Manitoba.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Letters were sent to health care providers each year outlining diagnostic testing recommendations. The Cadham Provincial Laboratory provides WNV Ab and NA testing on all clinical specimens in Manitoba. WNV Ab testing is performed using WNV IgM capture</p>
        <p>DxSelect kit. Screen positive specimens are confirmed using the subtraction method. Positive cases are reported to Manitoba Public Health for follow up. Laboratory and WNV surveillance data were analyzed for each year.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>There have been fluctuations in the number of blood specimens submitted for testing as well as in the number of Ab positive cases in the last 4 years. The highest and lowest annual numbers of WNV Ab positive individuals were 143 and 3 diagnosed in the years 2003 and 2004 respectively. The number of Ab positive cases in the years 2005 and 2006 were 58 and 51 respectively. Nine hundred ninety three specimens were tested for WNV NA over the last four years, of them only 1 specimen was positive. There was a continuous increase in the number of NA tests between 2003 and 2006 since testing of living organ donors using NA testing commenced in 2003. The positive cases presenting with neurological syndrome ranged across the four years between 17.2 and 33.3% of the total number of positive cases. The age distribution of the positive cases indicated that between 33.3 and 56.8% were in the age group of 40 to 60 years old. WNV infected females represented 33.3 to 51.7% of the total WNV Ab positive individuals. Higher rates of WNV infection (66.7 to 80.4%) were noticed in residents of rural Manitoba.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The Manitoba Health surveillance system identifies more severe cases of WNV infection than would be expected based on seroprevalence studies. The majority of WNV positive cases were residents of rural Manitoba which may be due to a number of factors, including amount of time spent outdoors.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) exhibiting small colony variant (scv) morphology, were first identified in Toronto late in 2004. This same strain has since been reported from large numbers of patients in more than 13 health care facilities in southern Ontario. Definitive species level identification was performed using PCR directed at the <italic>ddl-E. faecium</italic> gene, and by the sequencing of Chaperonin (Hsp60). The vancomycin resistance genotype was confirmed by PCR to be <italic>vanA</italic>. DNA typing by <italic>SmaI</italic> pulsed field gel electrophoresis found the scvVRE from all facilities to be indistinguishable. This study describes the laboratory characteristics of this epidemic clone.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Growth on common media was described. Identification to the species level using conventional biochemicals, API 20 Strep, Vitek-1 and Vitek-2 (bioM&#x000e9;rieux), MicroScan (Dade), and Phoenix (BD) was performed. Susceptibility testing by automated Vitek-1 (GPS-105) and Vitek-2 (AST-P532), MicroScan and Phoenix plus the manual broth microdilution, disc diffusion, and growth on the Brain Heart Infusion 6ug/mL vancomycin screen agar, as per Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, were completed.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Difficult to detect pinpoint colonies were visible within 24h on non-selective blood-containing media as well as the selective Bile Esculin Azide and mEnterococcus agars with 6ug/mL vancomycin. Gram stain showed large paired cocci. PYR, LAP and BE tests were positive. Acid from mannitol and arabinose was not detected without added serum/plasma. The API 20 Strep strip and Vitek-1 did not identify this variant, while Vitek-2, MicroScan and Phoenix all correctly identified it as <italic>E. faecium</italic>. All CLSI methods, MicroScan, and Phoenix showed resistance to ampicillin, vancomycin and teicoplanin, and susceptibility to line-zolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and to the high-level aminoglycosides, gentamicin and streptomycin. Susceptibility testing by Vitek-1 and Vitek-2 failed due to insufficient growth.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>All pinpoint colony Gram-positive cocci isolated in clinical microbiology laboratories should minimally be tested with PYR to rule out this epidemic scvVRE clone. Clinical laboratories should be aware that conventional biochemical tests without serum or plasma supplementation, the API 20 Strep strips and the Vitek-1 will not identify this variant strain and insufficient growth will prevent susceptibility testing by both Vitek-1 and Vitek-2.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>The purpose of this study was to compare parasite detection methods with traditional surrogate testing for drinking water and precipitation events. Our overall goal is to develop a better approach to surveillance of waterborne disease for the protection of public health.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A prospective 2-year study (Fall 2004 &#x02013; Fall 2006) was undertaken in a community in southwestern British Columbia (BC). This community was chosen because of ongoing multi-disciplinary studies on the area's drinking water sources. Sampling sites were selected based on the water flow from Source-to-Tap. Samples were collected every other week for laboratory testing for parasites (<italic>Giardia</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>) and microbial surrogates (total coliforms and <italic>E coli</italic>). Precipitation data were obtained from local Environment Canada weather stations. Rainfall events were defined as 2-standard deviations above the historical mean seasonal values for the study community. The number of cases of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis reported to public health for this community was compared with water sample laboratory results. Water samples for parasite testing were processed using US EPA Method 1623 (filtration, immuno-magnetic separation, and microscopy). Total/fecal coliforms were cultured using standard methods (membrane filtration, culture). Results were captured in spreadsheet and comparisons between parasite levels, bacterial surrogate levels and precipitation data was performed.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Seventy-one water samples were collected and tested for parasites and bacterial surrogates. Overall positivity rates for <italic>Giardia</italic> were 87% and for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> were 48%. All samples collected were positive for fecal coliforms. Temporal analysis between parasite (oo)cyst/100L and fecal coliform counts per 100ml showed no correlation. There was however a correlation between the parasite load and rainfall events. Furthermore, there were many more cases of giardiasis reported to public health than cryptosporidiosis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Coliforms are not a useful surrogate for the presence of parasites in drinking water. However, the findings suggest that rainfall should be considered as a potential surveillance tool for predicting drinking water parasite contamination events.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Norovirus is a small, highly infectious virus that causes symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea. It is easily transmitted person-to-person and can quickly spread by aerosols, causing large outbreaks in facility settings. This summary reviews the organisms causing outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease in British Columbia (BC) over 5 years, the types of facilities or events where outbreaks have occurred and seasonal variation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Collection and submission of outbreak samples is coordinated through the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) Laboratory Services. Information is gathered regarding the patient symptoms, numbers of persons ill, incubation period, duration of illness and attack rate. An algorithmic approach based on clinical findings was used for testing. Clinical specimens were tested for enteric pathogens by culture methods, Norovirus by a Reverse Transcription PCR method. Other viruses were examined by electron microscopy/enzyme immunosorbant assay and parasites by concentration/microscopy. All outbreak related test results were extracted from the lab information system and analyzed on a spreadsheet.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Between 2001 and 2005, the BCCDC Environmental Microbiology Laboratory investigated 910 outbreaks caused by 30 organisms causing gastrointestinal illness in BC. Of the outbreaks investigated, 4.4% were caused by bacterial organisms, chemical contamination or parasites. 65% were caused by viral organisms. Norovirus accounted for 98% of the viral outbreaks, 2% were caused by Rotavirus, Adenovirus and Torovirus. Outbreaks are occurring in all types of facilities, the majority in long term care facilities. Further analysis of data will be presented.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Norovirus, the major causative agent of gastrointestinal disease outbreaks in BC, is on the rise. Occurrences of outbreaks are no longer restricted to winter months and are seen throughout the year. Norovirus is impacting the BC health care system, particularly the acute care sector.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>We used MRSA Select agar (Marnes la Coquette, France; marketed in Canada by Bio-Rad Laboratories) in the same manner as Mueller Hinton with Oxacillin (MHO) is used, i.e. to screen for methi-cillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) as an supplement to conventional susceptibility testing.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Using the CLSI recommended method for MRSA screening on MHO; we spotted a similarly prepared inoculum onto MRSA Select media and incubated 24 hours at 35&#x000b0;C. The MHO plates were interpreted in the CLSI-recommended manner. MRSA Select plates were interpreted as positive (magenta colonies), indeterminate (pink colonies) and negative (no growth or white colonies). We included 123 non-duplicate strains of SA (28 MRSAs; 95 MSSAs) and 264 strains of coagulase negative staphylococci. Methicillin resistance was determined based on a commercial kit (Denka, Seiken Co, Niigata, Japan) and /or in-house PCR for the <italic>mecA</italic> gene. Additionally, when SA strains produced discrepant results on MHO vs MRSA Select, E-test susceptibilities were performed to identify borderline oxacillin resistant SA (BORSA).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The MRSA Select media detected 28 of 28 MRSA and was negative in 94 of 95 MSSA strains (1 strain was indeterminate). The MHO was falsely positive in 4 of 95 MSSAs. None of the 4 was a BORSA. None of the 264 coagulase negative staphylococci produce magenta colonies, six produced pink (indeterminate) colonies. The presence or absence or absence of magenta colonies on MRSA Select was 100% sensitive and 100% specific; the MHO screening plate was 100% sensitive and 87.5% specific.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The MRSA Select agar outperformed MHO when used to screen for methicillin resistance and provided the additional advantage of accurately confirming the speciation. Further evaluation is necessary using a more geographically diverse collection of strains.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To compare the costs associated with the use of MRSA Select (Marnes la Coquette, France; marketed in Canada by Bio-Rad Laboratories) and Mannitol Salt Agar with Oxacillin (MSO) for MRSA screening.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>We examined the costs associated using MRSA Select and MSO during two four-month periods in 2005 and 2006. We determined the proportion of suspicious colonies that required work up, the proportion that were MRSA and the resources consumed in discounting non-MRSA colonies. We used QEII HSC pay scales and our actual material and supply costs. MSO was made in-house. MSO plates were read daily for two days and MRSA Select for only one (in accordance with manufacturer's directions).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>During the four month period when MSO was used, 18,383 cultures were performed; 236 MRSA strains were isolated (1.3%). 4,995 suspicious colonies needed further work up (labour, subculture to one quarter blood agar plate and a tube coagulase test). Using MRSA Select, 12,650 cultures were performed, of which 288 were positive for MRSA (2.3%). Only 409 suspicious colonies required further workup. The positive predictive value of suspicious colonies on MSO was only 4.7% when compared with 62% for MRSA Select. The average cost per culture of supplemental testing of colonies on MSO that were not MRSA was $0.57 per culture as compared with $0.02 for MRSA Select. In addition, MSO required a second read (one minute; $0.50) on day 2 before reporting negatives. Cost per culture to purchase media, screen colonies and to re-examine plates (MSO) were $1.39 for MRSA select vs $1.46 for MSO. This non-concurrent study did not enable us to compare the sensitivity of each media.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Despite higher acquisition costs for MRSA Select, its higher specificity and the ability to report negatives only after 48 hours reduce total laboratory costs to below that of MSO.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Rapid real-time PCR can provide results within 1 hour of receipt of the specimen. For ward screening turn-around-time for detection of MRSA is a critical parameter for limiting the spread of this pathogen. However, previous studies have indicated that false-positives for rapid PCR testing may be a problem. The objective of this study was to compare rapid PCR for nasal swabs collected as part of ward-screening for MRSA detection to culture using MRSA enrichment broth (EB) or direct inoculation onto MO or MRSASelect&#x02122; (MRS) agar.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>The real-time PCR test used was the IDI-MRSA (BD Diagnostics, Mississauga, ON). Consecutive nasal swabs collected from ward screens in 2005 were included in the analysis. The swabs were eluted in buffer and the buffer was used for: 1) DNA extraction for PCR, 2) direct culture on MO or MRS and 3) EB. The EB consisted of BHI containing 5 ug/ml Ceftizoxime, and 75 ug/ml Aztreonam. MRS is a chomogenic media for detection of MRSA (pink colonies). The inoculated MO and MRS plates were read at 24 and 48 hours. The EB was incubated at 35&#x000b0;C for 24 hours and then plated to MO and MRS agar. The MO and MRS media were read at 24 and 48 hrs.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>There were 307 nasal swabs collected from ward screens that were evaluated by both PCR and culture. Of these 13 were positive for MRSA by at least one culture method. The rapid PCR detected 22 positives (13 that were culture positive and 9 that were culture negative). The direct MO culture method detected 9/13 MRSA positive samples. The EB detected all 13 MRSA positive nasal swabs. There were 146 of these swabs that were also cultured to MRS; 3 were positive and 143 were negative.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The EB detected all true MRSA (100% sensitivity and specificity) but required an additional 24 hours TAT. The PCR was 100% sensitive and 97.7% specific while direct culture to MO was 69.2% sensitive and 100% specific. MRS had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity (but the number of samples evaluated was low).</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Despite intensive screening programs, the prevention of methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) nosocomial transmission continues to challenge many Canadian hospitals. We evaluated the predictive capacity of a non-standardized direct cefoxitin disk test to presumptively identify MRSA isolates from routine clinical specimens.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>For a six-month period routine clinical isolates collected from any patient site that resembled <italic>S aureus</italic> morphologically at 24 hr of incubation were subcultured onto sheep blood agar, as per laboratory protocol. A 30 mg cefoxitin disk (Oxoid) was placed in the first quadrant of the subculture plate, which was incubated at 35&#x000b0;C for 18 to 24 hr. The inhibitory zone size of each isolate was measured and categorized as susceptible (S) or resistant (R) according to current Clinical Laboratories Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoint values (S &#x0003e;= 20 mm, R &#x0003c;= 19mm). Comparatively, a standard cefoxitin Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion (CLSI) was performed for each <italic>S aureus</italic> isolate. Confirmatory MRSA identification was performed using a PBP2A assay (Denka Seiken).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>518 <italic>S aureus</italic> isolates were collected from 372 patients that were evenly distributed across common specimen sites, including blood, respiratory, skin, and wounds. The direct and CLSI disk methods showed 100% breakpoint agreement (S, 79%) and cefoxitin R isolates were confirmed MRSA by PBP2A. However, the direct method provided presumptive MRSA results 24 hr sooner. Interestingly, only one isolate (0.2%) that was S by the CLSI method had an inhibitory zone &#x0003c;23 mm (21 mm). In contrast, using the direct cefoxitin method 72 isolates (14%) had a reduced S zone between 20 and 23 mm. Similar results were observed when the data was restricted to one isolate per patient.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>In this study, a non-standardized cefoxitin disk test reliably predicted cefoxitin susceptibility for clinical <italic>S aureus</italic> isolates 24 hrs sooner than that provided by CLSI disk diffusion. If adopted, this would allow faster laboratory reporting and infection control interventions for presumptive MRSA-positive patients. As a precautionary measure, infection control precautions could also be considered for patients with an isolate exhibiting a reduced S inhibitory zone size (20 to 23 mm) until confirmatory testing was complete.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Chromogenic agars specific for detecting MRSA have recently been developed by Bio-Rad (MRSA Select-MS) and Oxoid (Denim Blue-DB).These agars combine rapid primary growth and selectivity with differentiation from coagulase negative staphylococci. This study compares these two medias in terms of reliability, performance, and speed of obtaining results.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A) 71 archived isolates of C-MRSA 1, 2 and 3 recovered from routine screening sites were diluted to achieve a final count of 10&#x000d7;E4 CFU/plate These dilutions were inoculated onto DB and MS and incubated at 35&#x000b0;C. Plates were examined for amount of growth and assessed microscopically for size of colonies hourly between 18&#x02013;24 hrs. B) 750 patient samples were inoculated to both MS and DB plates upon arrival throughout November 2006. Incubation and readings were executed as in A. C) A summary of recovery sites for MRSA was tabulated.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A) All 71 archived MRSA isolates exhibited 3+ growth. MS presented mauve coloured colonies whereas DB provided blue colonies. DB supported 25% larger colonies than MS throughout the 18&#x02013;24 hrs. Because of the larger size, DB's colonies were more easily visible and an impression was given of a higher yield of growth. B) Out of a total of 35 positive MRSA samples, DB recovered all 35 whereas MS recovered 34. Occasional growths were easily missed using MS at 18 hrs but colonies became more visible at the 20 hr. mark. Both medias grew a &#x0201c;haze&#x0201d; with their respective colours if certain strains of <italic>Enterococcus</italic> were present. Strains of <italic>S sciuri</italic> and <italic>S epidermidis</italic> grew as white colonies on MS. Strains of <italic>S hemolyticus</italic> and <italic>S hominis</italic> presented as white colonies on both medias. C) The order of recovery sites for MRSA, highest to lowest: rectal&#x0003e;throat&#x0003e;nasal</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Both medias selected for and differentiated MRSA very well in a short period of time. Oxoid's Denim Blue was superior in sensitivity, in demonstrating larger, more distinct colonies, better contrast of colour with respect to background, more even fills and were Isoplater ready. Throat colonisation of MRSA was found to be more frequent than nasal carriage.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>The rapid, accurate and cost effective detection of MRSA from surveillance specimens is integral to laboratory workflow and to patient management. The availability of selective <italic>S. aureus</italic>-specific chro-mogenic agars has vastly improved the sensitivity, specificity and turnaround-time associated with MRSA detection. Previous studies found the MRSA<italic>Select</italic> (MS) to have a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 98% using a relative gold standard of four selective media. This study aimed to compare the Denim Blue (DB) agar to the MS that is currently in routine use.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Consecutive specimens received for MRSA screening were set up in parallel on DB and MS agars. The order of plating was rotated every 50 specimens throughout the study to prevent inoculation bias. After incubation in the dark at 37&#x000b0;C, the DB and MS were examined by different technologists at 18 and 24h for blue or pink colonies, respectively. Standard MRSA confirmatory methods (Bio-Rad Pastorex <italic>Staph Plus</italic>, Tube coagulase, Denka Seiken PBP2a agglutination, CLSI oxacillin screen) were performed directly from each agar when possible. Discrepancies were resolved by broth enrichment of the original swab and replanting to both media.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A total of 2,000 surveillance swabs (525 rectal, 549 nasal, 176 wound, 750 pooled nasal/axilla/groin/perineum swabs) from 1,053 patients in 12 hospitals (range 1&#x02013;8 swabs/patient) were included in the study. Of these, 71 (3.6%) grew MRSA from at least one medium, with 69 (97.1% of MRSA; 3.4% of specimens) being isolated from DB and 66 (93% of MRSA; 3.3% of specimens) being isolated from MS. 14 (0.7%) specimens planted to DB and 7 (0.4%) planted to MS grew blue and pink colonies, respectively, that proved not to be MRSA. Resulting sensitivities/specificities for DB were 97.2/99.3 and for MS were 93.4/99.6 percent, respectively. The positive/negative predictive values for DB were 83.5/99.9 and for MS were 91/99.7 percent, respectively. Preliminary data regarding the discrepant, found 3/4 did not grow after enrichment suggesting laboratory cross contamination, whilst the other grew MRSA on both agars.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>This preliminary data suggests that the DB and MS have very similar performance characteristics.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND</title>
        <p>The prevalence of MRSA continues to increase throughout Ontario. We describe the molecular epidemiology of MRSA (1990&#x02013;2006) and determined which strains predominate in our region.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>MRSA isolated from new patients are referred to the Ottawa Hospital for genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA (SmaI digests). Only the initial isolate from each patient was tested. PFGE profiles were interpreted according to the criteria of Tenover et al (1995). SCCmec typing was done by PCR.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The rate of new MRSA cases in EO remained relatively stable at 1.1/100,000 population from 1990&#x02013;1996. This increased 16 fold between in 1997&#x02013;2000 (16.0/100,000) and since 2001, there has been a consistent annual increase to a rate of 60/100,000 in 2006. In 1997, CMRSA-1 was the predominant strain (72% of all cases) followed by CMRSA-2 (14.5%). Since 1997, the proportion of CMRSA-1 has gradually decreased so that by 2004 it represents only 2% of isolates. In contrast, CMRSA-2 has increased annually so that in 2005, it represented 80% of all cases. In 2001, due to several hospital out breaks, CMRSA-8 increased significantly (36%) but subsequently decreased over the next 2 years. CMRSA-7 was first detected in 1990 and the numbers of cases have remained low at 1&#x02013;4 new cases per year. In contrast, CMRSA-10, which was first detected in 1999, represented 1&#x02013;7% of isolates between 2002&#x02013;2005. In 2006, CMRSA-10 increased dramatically (21% of isolates); this has been primarily due to significant increases in the number of outpatients presenting with this MRSA strain, a nosocomial outbreak at one acute care hospital, and an outbreak in a regional detention centre. SCCmec typing of 94 CMRSA-7 and 10 isolates revealed that 16 were type II, 76 were type IVa and 3 were untypeable.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>MRSA continues to increase in this region with CMRSA-2 being the most common strain encountered. MRSA strains which are associated with &#x0201c;community acquisition&#x0201d;, especially CMRSA-10, are now the second most frequently encountered strain in EO.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND and OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>A recent US study of adults with suspected ONY has shown that CB, a nonfluorescent stain, is a sensitive and cost-effective assay for the diagnosis of ONY. This study compared the CB staining method with the CW preparation for the diagnosis of DER and ONY in patients from across Saskatchewan, both children and adults.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>78 skin and 150 nail specimens from patients with suspected DER or ONY were included in study during 2006. Each specimen was divided equally for each of the following tests: CB, CW and cultures with Sabouraud dextrose agar containing chloramphenicol and cycloheximide (SC) and Littman oxgall agar containing chloramphenicol (LA). CB and CW smears were evaluated microscopically under light and fluorescent microscope, respectively. Smears were considered positive if hyphae/arthroconidia, and yeast cells/pseudohyphae suggestive of der-matophytes and yeasts, respectively, were seen. Cultures were considered positive if dermatophytes and/or yeasts were isolated from SC and LA. Dermatophytes and yeasts were identified using conventional methods. Smear results were compared to reference fungal culture results.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Staining results of the 78 skin samples showed that CB staining had 86.7% sensitivity, 96.8% specificity, 86.7% positive and 96.8% negative predictive values compared with 86.7% sensitivity, 98.4% specificity, 92.8% positive and 96.8% negative predictive values for the CW assay. The staining data on the 150 nail specimens showed CB staining had a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 97.5%, 81.8%, 66.1% and 98.9%, respectively compared with 95% sensitivity, 80% specificity, 63.3% positive and 97.8% negative predictive values for the CW staining procedure.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The CB staining method performed as well as the CW staining assay for the detection of fungal elements in skin and nail specimens. The CB test is a rapid method for the diagnosis of ONY as well as DER in both children and adults, with the use of a light microscope.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The Canadian National Centre for Mycology (NCM) provides susceptibility testing of yeast and filamentous fungi for Canadian laboratories submitting specimens for routine mycology or isolates for confirmatory testing. The purpose of this study was to determine the anti-fungal susceptibility rates of clinical <italic>Candida</italic> isolates submitted to the NCM over the past ten years.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Susceptibility testing of <italic>Candida</italic> isolates was performed according to the Clinical Laboratories Standards Institute (CLSI) M27A-2 document for broth microdilution (BMD) testing of yeast. BMD panels containing RPMI broth with MOPS buffer, and doubling dilutions of antifungal agents, were inoculated with 10e3 CFU/ml of the test isolate and incubated at 35&#x000b0;C for 48 hours. Antifungal agents included amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, fluconazole, intraconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin; the latter two agents were tested against 2004 and 2005 isolates only. The 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) averaged from total annual isolates was recorded to monitor temporal trends.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>From 1995 to 2005 the most common species submitted to the NCM annually included <italic>C albicans</italic>, <italic>C glabrata</italic>, <italic>C parapsolosis</italic>, and <italic>C tropi-calis</italic> with 801, 421, 188, and 96 total isolates, respectively, and primarily consisted of invasive isolates. Overall, MIC90 values remained unchanged and showed little evidence of reduced susceptibility to the antifungal agents tested; amphotericin B &#x0003c;= 4mg/L, 5-fluorocytosine &#x0003c; = 8mg/L, intra-conazole &#x0003c; = 16mg/L, voriconazole &#x0003c; = 2mg/L, and caspofungin &#x0003c; = 2mg/L. However, for fluconazole the <italic>C albicans</italic> MIC90 decreased from 16mg/L to 4mg/L while <italic>C glabrata</italic> MIC90 increased from 8mg/L to 64mg/L.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Despite reported increases of invasive candidiasis, this passive surveillance of <italic>Candida</italic> susceptibility rates indicates that recommended antifungal agents remain quite active against the most common infecting species. However, <italic>C glabrata</italic> resistance to the azoles is increasing in Canada. As new antifungal agents become available, continued and increased surveillance is necessary to monitor the emergence of resistance.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Recent outbreaks of Fusarium keratitis associated with soft contact lens use have been reported from Singapore and United States. An association was found with Bausch and Lomb (B&#x00026;L) Renu with MoistureLoc multi-purpose contact lens solution leading to a voluntary world-wide recall in May 2006 and extensive investigations. Our objective is to describe the first known case in Canada and the implications for contact lens wearers.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A 15 year old student visiting Vancouver from Australia presented with a one day history of photophobia, blurred vision, redness and pain in the right eye. She wore soft contact lenses (B&#x00026;L) on a daily basis. Atypical bacterial or fungal infection was diagnosed and treatment was started with ofloxacin and then moxifloxacin. Swabs of the wells of the contact lens case, the tip and cap of the contact solution bottle, the contact lens and a sample of the solution itself were submitted for direct stains and culture for pathogens. Corneal scrapings from the affected eye were also submitted for examination.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Filamentous fungi were seen from the calcofluor white stained smear made from the contact lens case. All other smears were negative for fungal elements. Treatment was switched to 1% voriconazole drops. Cultures of both the contact lens case and the contact lens itself grew mold which were presumptively identified as Fusarium species based on morphology. These isolates were determined, by sequencing of the 18S internal transcribed spacer region, to have 99% similarity to the Fusarium solanii complex.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>This case appears to be epidemiologically and molecularly linked to the outbreak of fusarium keratitis recently reported. Although the product was never marketed in Canada, travellers and Canadian residents unaware of the recall may have bought their lens solution outside of the country. A Public Health Advisory was issued by the BCCDC, Vancouver on 18th August, 2006. Follow up of the patient over the next 2 days showed improved symptoms and she was able to resume her travel plans.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Feces from patients with <italic>C difficile</italic> associated diarrhea (CDAD) is known to contain spores and the efficacy of eradication of these spores by the thermal conditions in ward bedpan washers (Ward-BPW) is unknown. The aim of this study was to use simulated-use testing to evaluate the efficacy of <italic>C difficile</italic> spore elimination by ward-BPW compared to Central Processing Dept washers (CPD-BPW).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>The effect of thermal killing of <italic>C difficile</italic> spores at 80&#x000b0;C and 90&#x000b0;C was evaluated. The efficacy of ward and CPD bedpan washers to eliminate <italic>C difficile</italic> spores from bedpans was evaluated. Briefly <italic>C difficile</italic> spores were suspended in ATS (Artificial Test Soil) to give &#x0223c; 10<sup>6</sup> cfu/mL and 0.1 mL of this was spread over a defined surface area of the bedpan and allowed to dry overnight. The inoculated bedpans were processed using the Ward-BPW or the CPD-BPW. Residual <italic>C difficile</italic> spores were detected by culture of the inoculated area on the bedpan using a Rodac plate containing CDMN media.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Using suspension testing our data showed that the <italic>C difficile</italic> spore count was not reduced after 5 minutes at 90&#x000b0;C. Simulated-use testing demonstrated that the ward-BPW did not effectively eliminate <italic>C difficile</italic> spores from inoculated bedpans whereas the CPD-BPW did. The thermal disinfection cycle in both the ward and CPD bedpan washers was 85&#x000b0;C for 1 to 5 minutes. Exposure to these conditions resulted in &#x0223c;1 Log<sub>10</sub> reduction in spores. However, the 85&#x000b0;C for 1 min combined with the 116&#x000b0;C drying cycle for 7 mins used by the CPD-BPW killed 6 Log<sub>10</sub>
          <italic>C difficile</italic> spores.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Our data showed that the Ward-BPW tested did not have sufficient thermal conditions to effectively kill <italic>C difficile</italic> spores (the ISO15883&#x02013;3 guidance document recommends these thermal conditions as adequate for bedpans). Ward BPWs still provide an effective means of disposing of fecal waste from bedpans without generating aerosols. Manufacturers may be able to make adjustments to bedpan washers to achieve conditions that will effectively eliminate <italic>C difficile</italic> spores.</p>

        <p>Results indicate there may be differences in the sensitivity of test kits for <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin; however, results were confounded by the fact that some labs diluted the samples while others did not. Specificity was excellent for all kits used. This pilot survey was considered successful and two <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin detection EQA surveys are planned for 2007.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To increase awareness of Rat Bite Fever in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with fever, rash and polyarthritis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CLINICAL PRESENTATION</title>
        <p>A 9 year old boy presented to the Emergency Department on the weekend with a five day history of fever. Subsequently, he developed a non-pruritic rash, especially on his feet. Three days previously, he also complained of pain in his right knee with difficulty walking. The day of assessment, he complained of tenderness in his left elbow that then migrated to his left shoulder. He was thought to have a &#x02018;viral&#x02019; illness. In consultation, it was noted that his past history was unremarkable. His immunizations were up to date. He had had no recent immunizations. He had no foreign travel. He had not been on the Thousand Islands. He did not have a history of tick bites. He had no contact with wild animals. He had not been in a hot tub. On clinical examination, he was alert. Abnormalities noted included swelling of both knees. There was pain on movement of the left shoulder. He had an ery-thematous maculopapular rash, most prominent on the soles of his feet and lower legs.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>His white cell count was 7.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L with a normal differential. His ASOT was negative. His CRP of 18 mg/L and his ESR of 43 mm/hour were elevated. Serology for Lyme Disease was negative. He had IgG, but not IgM antibodies to Parvovirus B19. Blood cultures were positive for <italic>Streptobacillus moniliformis</italic>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>After the child had left the Emergency Department, his grandmother reported that the family had recently purchased a pet rat &#x02013;that they initially had not considered a wild animal. The boy enjoyed playing with the rat on his bed. He did not recall being bitten by the rat. A potential diagnosis of Rat Bite fever was made. Antibiotic therapy was commenced. Clinically he had improved prior to the <italic>Streptobacillus moniliformis</italic> being cultured from his blood. This presentation will illustrate the clinical findings of Rat Bite Fever, as well as highlight a potentially treatable zoonosis in Canada as rats become more frequent family pets.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>1. To compare ELISA and IFA assays for detection of <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic> IgM and IgG antibodies, for diagnosis of <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> infection. 2. To establish an ELISA IgG cutoff value equivalent to the IFA IgG 1:512 titre considered to be indicative of active <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> infection.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Sera previously tested for <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> IgM and IgG antibodies by IFA (Focus Diagnostics) were tested with ELISA assays for <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> IgM and IgG (Euroimmun). IFA titres ranged from &#x0003c;1:16 to 1:2048. Eleven sera with IFA IgG titres of 1:512 were diluted two-fold for a series of 3 dilutions and tested with the ELISA IgG assay. Using the manufacturers&#x02019; established IFA ranges of &#x0003e;=1:512 for IgG and &#x0003e;=1:10 for IgM as indicative of acute infection, sera were tested using a quantitative IgG ELISA, to establish a comparable Relative Units/mL (RU/mL) cutoff.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>An IgG ELISA value of 120 RU/mL for <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> was comparable to the IFA IgG &#x0003e;=1:512. Of 104 sera analysed in the IgG evaluation, 26 were positive and 70 were negative by both IFA and ELISA methods. 8 sera were discordant (IFA positive and ELISA negative). The overall agreement between IgG assays was 92.3%, positive agreement was 76.5% and negative agreement was 100%. Of 24 sera analysed in the IgM evaluation, 9 were positive and 10 were negative by both IFA and ELISA methods. 5 sera were discordant (IFA positive and ELISA negative). The overall agreement between IgM assays was 79.2%; positive agreement was 66.7% and negative agreement was 100%. The subjectivity associated with IFA interpretation was associated with a positive bias.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>ELISA screening for antibodies to <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> is a good alternative to traditional IFA methods, providing rapid, high volume throughput, without the subjectivity of IFA.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>There are impending threats of viral respiratory infections for healthcare workers and first responders (SARS, influenza). Most occupational health authorities thus recommend the use of NIOSH-rated N95 (or higher) respirators in situations suspected of involving an airborne infectious microbial hazard. Such certification requires a 95% (or higher) filtration efficiency against aerosolized 0.3 um particles. Considering that most viruses of pathogenic concern are smaller than 0.3 um in size, and that the most penetrating particle size through charged fibers shifts towards the nano-sized range (&#x02264; 0.1 um), this represents insufficient protection. We combined an iodinated bioactive polymer to the mechanical filtration equivalent of an N95, developing a respirator offering enhanced protection against airborne viruses.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Viral Removal Efficiency (VRE) of respirators was evaluated by full-sized device testing against a viral surrogate, MS2 coliphage (0.025 um), and an animal virus, human influenza A/H1N1 (diameter ranging from 0.08 to 0.12 um). Collison nebulizers generate a bioaerosol containing 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/m<sup>3</sup> of air, which is then filtered through the respirators at a flow rate of 85 LPM. Effluent air is recovered in All Glass Impingers operated in parallel.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The iodinated polymer-containing (IPC) respirator was assessed for its VRE alongside standard N95, N99 and P95 respirators for 2 to 8 hours of filtration. The IPC reduced aerosolized concentrations of both MS2 coliphage and influenza by an additional 1-log to 3-log, translating into VRE performances of 99% to 99.99%. Standard respirators showed VRE results in the range of 90% to 99.9%.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The iodinated polymer-containing respirator demonstrated superior VRE results against both viral challenges; higher concentrations of airborne viruses were allowed through standard respirators.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To compare RVP to the current in-house RT-PCR for Influenza A &#x00026; B, isolation in cell culture and to explore the respiratory virus profile associated with ILI among outpatient visits.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Between 2005-11-01 and 2006-04-04, 528 respiratory specimens were received by the BC Centre for Disease Control from sentinel physicians. Nucleic acid was extracted from180 specimens using Qiagen BioRobot 9604 and tested for Influenza A &#x00026; B by RT-PCR and inoculated into cell cultures (RMK, AD549 and MRC5 cells). Extracted nucleic acid preparations, stored at &#x02212;80C were retrospectively tested by the Tm Bioscience RVP kit.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Of the 180 specimens, Influenza A and B were detected in 48 and 40, respectively by both RT-PCR and RVP. One influenza B was detected by RVP alone. Parainfluenza 1 and Adenovirus were detected in one specimen each by both isolation and RVP. Viruses detected exclusively by the RVP assay included: Parainfluenza 1 (1), Coronavirus HKU1 (3), Coronavirus NL63 (1), Rhino/Enterovirus (10), Human Metapneumovirus (10), Parainfluenza 4 (1) and Respiratory Syncytial virus (3). No virus was detected in 59 specimens by either the RVP assay, RT-PCR or viral isolation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>The Tm Bioscience RVP and the in-house RT-PCR assays were shown to be comparable for detection of influenza A &#x00026; B viruses. Because the laboratory has not used optimal methods to detect novel agents such as human metapneumovirus and coronavirus the findings of the RVP assay could not be independently assessed. The RVP assay promises to be a valuable tool for comprehensive screening of respiratory viruses in outbreak settings and suggests that various viruses contribute to the clinical syndrome of ILI which may remain undetected by conventional viral testing.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND</title>
        <p>Although pregnant women are at high risk for severe influenza infection during pandemics, it is not clear whether they are at risk during normal influenza seasons. We explored the attitudes of Canadian women to determine whether implementation of a universal annual influenza immunization program of all pregnant women similar to that recommended in the United States would be successful in Canada.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A self-administered questionnaire, designed for this study, was distributed to all pregnant women receiving routine prenatal care in the obstetrics clinics of the IWK Health Centre and local physicians&#x02019; offices. The survey encompassed demographic information, including previous vaccination behaviour, as well as questions designed to elicit knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours regarding influenza vaccine during pregnancy.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Of the first 445 respondents, 36% agreed or strongly agreed that pregnant women are at higher risk of severe illness from influenza than women who are not pregnant. However, 51% of respondents did not think the vaccine was safe in all stages of pregnancy; 41% agreed or strongly agreed that it was safer to wait until after the first 3 months; and 30% felt it was best to avoid all vaccines while pregnant. Despite 60% of respondents stating that they would have the vaccine while pregnant if their doctor recommended it, and 54% citing their doctor/nurse as their primary source of vaccine information, only 15% said their doctor discussed influenza vaccination during their pregnancy. Those women whose doctors discussed influenza vaccine during pregnancy had higher overall knowledge scores (p&#x0003c;.0001) and were more likely to disagree or strongly disagree with the statement that it is best to avoid all vaccines while pregnant.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>These data indicate that Canadian women will be more likely to accept the influenza vaccine during pregnancy if recommended by their health care provider. Increased educational efforts directed towards health care professionals and the public regarding the safety and importance of influenza vaccination during pregnancy is warranted to ensure that pregnant women are provided information appropriate to make an informed decision.</p>

        <title>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Increasing rates of Sexually transmitted infection (STI) are occurring locally, provincially, and nationally and are of concern as they put women at risk for long term sequelae. Recent studies have shown that non-invasive tests such as urine and vaginal swabs are accurate and sensitive specimens for the detection of Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). These specimens are often preferred by patients due to their less invasive nature. This study evaluated a population of sexually active adolescents to assess which non-invasive specimen type they preferred as a screening method for detecting CT and GC. Reasons for this preference were assessed.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Adolescents who were sexually active and English speaking were approached in 4 Public Health run Sexual health clinics and asked to enrol in the study. Participants were asked to complete a pretest survey aimed at identifying factors, which may influence preference and then collected a urine specimen and 2 vaginal swabs. These specimens were tested using 2 different NAAT tests (AptimaCombo2 and BDProbeTec). Participants then completed an exit survey, which addressed patient preference and reasons for this.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>112 adolescents were enrolled in the study, 7 cases of CT were detected (6.3%), no cases of GC were detected. 109 (97%) participants returned both pre and post test questionnaires. Vaginal swabs were the preferred specimen type for 47.7% of participants followed by urine testing (31.2%) and cervical swabs (19.3%). Most participants reported vaginal swabs were &#x0201c;easy to collect&#x0201d; (84.4%) while 83.5% indicated that urine is &#x0201c;hard to collect&#x0201d;. 72.5% of participants felt that they would have more frequent STI testing done if SCVS were available for testing and 76.1% reported that they would be likely to collect their own specimens and mail them in for analysis. Nine Public Health Nurses (PHNs) completed a questionnaire at the end of the study and 55% ranked that they were very comfortable and confident with testing patients with SCVS while 89% ranked urine in this manner. PHNs were likely to underestimate patient comfort with SCVS specimens.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>This study demonstrated that adolescents were more comfortable with SCVS than PHNs were and may prefer SCVS over urine testing for detecting STIs. This specimen type may allow mail-in testing which is a desirable alternative for adolescents.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To evaluate three automated platforms for detection of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (Ct) and <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (Ng) by nucleic acid amplification in first void urine specimens.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>500 first void urine specimens were each tested for the presence of Ct and Ng using the Viper system (Becton Dickinson), the Tigris system (GenProbe) and the <italic>m</italic>2000 (Abbott Molecular Diagnostics). Positive results were confirmed using the method recommended by the manufacturer. Specimens giving discrepant results were further analyzed using in-house PCR assays.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The overall prevalence of Ct and Ng were 19.8% and 4.8% respectively. The respective sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the systems for detection of Ct were 97.96%, 99.5%, 97.96% and 99.5% (BD), 98.98%, 100%, 100% and 99.75% (GenProbe), and 89.6%, 100%, 100% and 97.58% (Abbott). The respective sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the systems for detection of Ng were 95.83%, 100%, 100% and 99.8% (BD), 100%, 100%, 100% and 100% (GenProbe), and 100%, 100%, 100% and 100% (Abbott).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The three automated platforms for detection of Ct and Ng all performed well. Important differences in maximum daily throughput were observed; the Tigris system had the highest throughput and was least labour-intensive, while <italic>m</italic>2000 system could process the fewest number of specimens per day. Of the three systems, only the Tigris used confirmatory assays that employed different targets than the primary assay, as recommended in the CDC guidelines for NAAT detection of Ct and Ng. Factors other than analytical sensitivity and specificity are important in evaluating automated systems for Ct and Ng detection in high-volume laboratories.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>In February 2005, enhanced national surveillance for LGV was initiated by PHAC. Previously, LGV was thought to occur rarely in Canada, with cases being linked to travel or immigration from endemic countries. Here, testing of referrals sent to the NML that fit national case definitions for LGV are described. Distribution of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT) serovars based on sequencing of the <italic>omp</italic>1 gene are reported.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>By PHAC case definitions, the NML is to test specimens from symptomatic patients where LGV, not CT, is suspected. Patient histories were reviewed for compliance with NML acceptance criteria. Acceptable specimen types included single or paired sera. Specimens from site of infection associated with LGV included bubo aspirates, perianal, anal, rectal swabs, other sites. In some instances, both sera and clinical specimens were received. Sera were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies towards CT by microimmuno-fluorescence (MIF) method using a commercial kit (Focus Diagnostics) and an in-house prepared L2 antigen. Clinical samples were screened by Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) using the Roche Amplicor PCR kit and in-house PCR assays that detected CT-specific 16s rRNA and the <italic>omp1</italic> gene, which if positive were sequenced to determine the serovar. Positive specimens based on PHAC guideline values, were analyzed.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>1489 specimens were tested over a 24 month interval. Serology: 141/962 (15%) sera tested were positive. <underline>Clinical samples:</underline> 565 specimens were tested. 225 (40%) were positive for CT; of these, 36% [82/225] were associated with <underline>L2</underline>, that is, were laboratory-confirmed for LGV. The distribution of remaining CT serovars (% of 225) : <underline>D</underline> 20%, <underline>E</underline> 7%, <underline>F</underline> 2%, <underline>G</underline> 12%, <underline>H</underline> 1%, <underline>I</underline> 0.5%, <underline>J</underline> 12%, <underline>K</underline> 0.5% with 4% being non-typable. All confirmed LGV cases continue to be associated with the target patient population of men who have sex with men, and are often coinfected with HIV and other STIs.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>We found that serological testing CT LGV diagnosis is difficult to interpret and should be considered to be of limited value, because LGV and non-LGV serovars cannot be eassily differentiated, in spite of inclusion in national case definitions. Molecular testing of clinical samples nearly always provides definitive results. We report here that a significant burden of this once rare STI continues to circulate in Canada among MSM.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>In 2005, enhanced surveillance for <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT) serovar L associated with lymphogranuloma venereum (CT LGV) was implemented nationally, after detection of cases of an invasive form of that disease in Canada and other western countries. Previously, it was thought to be a very rare disease and so prevalence was not specifically studied. Information concerning CT LGV and test procedures are provided on the PHAC website; the NML is to provide testing to discern between CT and CT LGV. Reorganization at the NML resulted in an opportunity to review all aspects of testing. Guidelines were vetted in order to create acceptance or rejection criteria for specimens. An overview of tests/criteria used to establish if a CT case is a case of LGV, are outlined.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>national guidelines for lab diagnosis of CT and CT LGV and technical methods used for CT and LGV testing, were reviewed. Specimens received for testing were evaluated to see if they fit usual symptoms and target risk population for LGV disease. Specimens were deemed as being positive based on PHAC website guidelines</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Serology testing is done using the microimmunofluorescence method [MIF]. Titres of IgM and IgG for both CT (commercial antigen [AG]) and LGV [in-house AG] are tested at the NML. Technical difficulties associated with interpreting serological tests, ie concurrent increase in titre to AGs for CT and LGV, submissions of poorly timed sera, and cross reactivity with other species in the genus, exist. Nucleic acid amplification testing [NAATs] used at the NML includes a commercial kit [Roche] to detect CT, in parallel with 2 in-house NAATs [specific 16S, <italic>omp</italic>1 genes] and controls. If detected, the <italic>omp</italic>1 gene is sequenced to determine if serovar L, the type associated with LGV, or if one of serovars D, E, F, G, H, I, J or K, associated with CT not LGV, is present. NAAT testing, not being validated for use with specimens derived from non-genital sites, is a significant caveat. Creation of guidelines has assisted with focusing test efforts on specimens derived from higher-risk patient types. Positive LGV specimens referred to the NML appear to be still exclusively associated with symptomatic men who have sex with men, and were not found among other patients types. Specimens from other patient populations are accepted for testing under specific circumstances.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To validate the claim that the newly available &#x0201c;flocked swab&#x0201d; (Starplex Starswab Multitrans Collection and Transport System) increases the yield of epithelial cells from samples taken for routine respiratory virus diagnostic testing, over the currently used standard Dacron nasopharyngeal swabs.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Infection Control Practitioners, skilled in the collection of nasopharyngeal swabs, collected 66 samples from 33 healthy volunteers. The method of collection was a published standard. One nostril was sampled using the standard swab, followed by the second nostril sampled with the flocked swab. Sample material was eluted into equal volumes of phosphate buffered saline and smears were made from a standard volume of the eluted material. Smears were stained with Evan's Blue and a technologist observed 5 random fields at 400&#x000d7; magnification per set of samples and counted the observed epithelial cells recovered from each swab type.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>On average the cellular recovery for the flocked swab was 36% higher than the standard Dacron swab (range 19%-48%). Further statistical analysis was not carried out and increased sensitivity of virus detection using the flocked swab could not be determined as the samples were taken from asymptomatic normal volunteers and the purpose of the study was simply to determine if a greater number of epithelial cells could be obtained using the new swab. However, higher cell recovery should result in increased detection of respiratory viruses by DFA, EIA, Culture and Molecular methods. The volunteers did not report any significant level of discomfort when the slightly larger flocked swab was used. The individuals collecting the samples found the flocked swabs easy to use and a definite improvement over nasal aspirate collection methods.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The newly introduced Starplex Starswab Multitrans Collection and Transport System (S160-NASO) has been shown to recover an increased number of epithelial cells from nasopharyngeal samples collected for the diagnosis of respiratory viral disease over traditional Dacron swabs. Combined with the previously demonstrated efficacy of the transport media for maintaining virus viability and desirable features like room temperature storage, this product is an improvement for the collection of upper respiratory specimens for viral diagnosis.</p>

      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>341 urines collected for culture were poured over a routine culture paddle (Starplex Dip N&#x02019; Count). The preservative sponge (Uriswab, Copan Italia) was then dipped into the remaining urine to absorb the sample (approximately 5s). The culture paddle was incubated 18 to 24h and read according to standard quantitation protocols. Urine from the sponge was cultured by squeezing the tube to express the urine with a 0.001 mL calibrated loop, urine from the sponge tube was plated onto blood and MacConkey agar. The plates were incubated 18&#x02013;24h and read according to standard quantitation protocols. Significant cultures were considered as those that contained urinary tract pathogens at amounts considered to reflect probable urinary infection.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>320 of the cultures (94%) yielded equivalent results for quantitation and micro-organism isolated. There were 21 discrepant results between the two systems; 9 (2.6%) had potential pathogens isolated. Of these, 5 were the same organism with the culture paddle having a one log higher count; the remaining 4 did not grow from the sponge. One of these showed 100 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/L on the culture paddle. The remaining 12 discrepant results (3.5%) were not clinically significant: 8 of the 12 were lac-tobacilli that were not supported by the preservative sponge.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>In this study, for detection of patients with a potentially significant urinary infection, the two systems agreed in 97.4% of cases. Differences in volume inoculated or sampling error might account for the quantitative variation observed in a few cultures. The preservative sponge appeared to reduce the growth of common contaminants such as lactobacilli and diphtheroids. The preservative sponge may offer a simple alternative method to transport urine for microbial culture for patients suspected of having a urinary tract infection.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Tuberculosis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Direct PCR for the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTB) IS<italic>6110</italic> target from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded patient samples may be a useful means of identifying infected patients. The objective of this study was to create a clinical prediction rule that would assist clinicians in predicting the likelihood of MTB-PCR positivity in specimens based on certain characteristics.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Between 2000 and 2006, The Ontario Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL), received formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues for <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> complex IS<italic>6110</italic> PCR. Samples were correlated to a copy of the corresponding pathology report indicating the type of biopsy tissue, the presence or absence of granulomata and the presence or quantity of AFB seen. DNA extracted from patient samples was utilized for IS<italic>6110 M tuberculosis</italic> complex PCR. The association between specimen characteristics and MTB-PCR positive results were evaluated using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. A clinical prediction rule was created with points assigned to an individual specimen based on the relative size of raw model covariates. The predictive validity of scores where assessed by both calibration (plotting specimen scores against the likelihood of a positive MTB-PCR result) and discrimination (construction of a receiver operating characteristic curve and parametric 95% confidence intervals).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Of the 173 specimens (171 fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues and two fresh tissue samples) received for MTB-PCR, the most common specimen types were; lymph node, spleen or bone marrow (n=55, 32%), lung or pleura (n=30, 17%), gastrointestinal tract or liver (n=18, 10%) or the genitourinary tract (n=17, 10%). Most samples (91%) had granulomata present, and a minority (19%) had AFB seen. Multivariable predictors of a positive MTB-PCR result were AFB quantity (multivariable odds ratio (OR) 6.11, 95% CI 1.80 to 20.74) and AFB quantity-squared (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.95), lymph node, spleen or bone marrow tissue source (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.17 to 6.57), and genitourinary tissue source (OR 4.03, 95% CI 1.18 to 13.82). Eighty percent of specimens with high point scores (&#x02265; 10) were highly likely (80%) to be MTB-PCR positive. The discriminatory ability of the rule was moderate (area under the ROC curve 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.78).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Using histopathology, the best predictor of MTB-PCR positivity is the presence of AFB in modest numbers; while specimens with many visible AFB were less likely to be associated with a positive MTB-PCR result. External validation of this tool may allow for the creation of rules that will improve how MTB-PCR is used to directly diagnose of MTB in biopsy samples.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>We report 5 cases of <italic>M. africanum</italic> and <italic>M caprae</italic> infection &#x02013;3 pulmonary and 2 extra-pulmonary &#x02013; recognized in Qu&#x000e9;bec in the past 5 years. The <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> complex (<italic>Mtb</italic>C) traditionally comprised <italic>M tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>M bovis</italic>, <italic>M africanum</italic>, and <italic>M microti</italic>. Recently, new species have been described and assigned to this complex including <italic>M caprae</italic>, <italic>M pinnipedii</italic>, and <italic>M</italic> &#x0201c;<italic>canetti</italic>&#x0201d;. In Canada, so far, no isolation of <italic>Mtb</italic>C species other than <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> or <italic>M bovis</italic> has been documented.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Identification of the isolates was confirmed using a PCR-based method testing for characteristic deleted regions-of-difference (RD) using primers based on genes within or flanking these deletions. Antituberculous drug testing was performed using the radiometric method with 12B broth (BACTEC&#x02122; 460TB). Case histories were reviewed to corroborate the identification.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Isolates showed fastidious growth on Lowenstein-Jensen and Middlebrook 7H10. They were susceptible to all first-line drugs. Genomic analysis found deletions of RD7 to RD10 in all isolates. <italic>M africanum</italic> and <italic>M caprae</italic> were further differentiated by deletion of RD701 but presence of RD12, and deletion of RD12 but presence of RD4 and/or NRD17 respectively. Evidence to support the identification was found in 4 out of 5 cases. For <italic>M africanum</italic>, strains were isolated from sputum, and paravertebral fluid, in 2 patients of Senegalese origin. The 3rd strain was isolated from a Quebec-born individual who had worked for 1&#x000bd; years in Senegal and Mauritania. For <italic>M caprae</italic>, the 1st strain was isolated from the peritoneal fluid of a patient of Cambodian origin. However, the 2nd strain was isolated from a Quebec-born individual for whom no social or clinical history could explain the pulmonary infection with this species.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Since 2002, <italic>M africanum</italic> and <italic>M caprae</italic> have now joined <italic>M bovis</italic> as part of the rarer causative agents of tuberculosis in humans to be considered in Qu&#x000e9;bec. With the enhanced laboratory capacity to recognize the traditional as well as the new members of the <italic>Mtb</italic>C, a more comprehensive epidemiological picture of these emerging human pathogens will likely follow.</p>

        <p>To examine patterns of pathogens co-association observed in a large sample of clinical acute respiratory specimens.</p>

        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>During the spring 2006 respiratory virus season, 1742 nasopha-ryngeal wash specimens submitted to the clinical diagnostic VIRAP program were examined by a multiplex molecular bead-array based assay for the presence of 21 common respiratory pathogens. Following collection of all data, statistical methods were applied to look for patterns of co-association (both positive and negative) between the examined pathogens.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>A number of statistically relevant patterns of pathogen co-association were observed. Examples of both positive interactions (where infection with one agent resulted in increased likelihood of sample positivity for the second agent) and negative interactions (where infection with one agent decreased the likelihood of positivity for the second agent) were found and are described. While some of the interactions detected by this study are known from previously published literature and thereby serve to validate the experimental approach, several of the observed patterns are novel and may have implications for clinical management.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Historically, most infectious disease diagnostic methods are flowscheme based and cease analysis on detection of the first relevant pathogen; this has resulted in a knowledge base of case histories defined as single-pathogen in etiology. This is the case even in the setting of acute respiratory infection, where the concept of secondary or coinfection is well known. The recent development of highly multiplex analytic methods such as that employed here provide evidence that coinfections are both more frequent than commonly believed, and that pathogen &#x02013; pathogen interactions in the respiratory setting are highly complex. Further study to augment our knowledge of the true pathogen spectrum present in these cases and their subsequent outcomes is warranted.</p>

      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Cadaveric sera collected from September 2005 to October 2006 were tested in parallel for HBsAg (n=505) and anti-HIV (n=349) on the two test systems and the percent agreement between the tests was calculated.</p>

        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>There was excellent agreement between the Bayer ADVIA Centaur&#x02122; and Genetic Systems&#x02122; assays for the detection of HBsAg and anti-HIV in cadaveric sera. It would be advantageous to laboratories performing organ/tissue donor testing to have available an automated platform for cadaveric specimens to reduce hands-on time for testing and turnaround time.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>POW virus is a flavivirus that belongs to the tick-borne encephalitis antigenic complex. The virus has been associated with neurological disease in North America, including two cases contracted in New Brunswick. The objective of this study was to carry out a phylogenetic analysis of the first POW virus isolate obtained from Atlantic Canada.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A POW virus-infected <italic>Ixodes cookei</italic> tick collected from a dog in PEI in June 2000 was homogenized in culture medium and inoculated into suckling mice. After 7 days, suspensions of homogenized mouse brain were added to Vero cells to obtain an isolate. Propagation of POW virus was confirmed by RT-PCR and amplicons were generated from the envelope, NS5 polymerase coding sequences, and the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (3&#x02032; UTR) for genomic characterization. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments were performed using DNA Star software and phylo-genetic trees constructed using MEGA 3.1 with neighbour-joining analysis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Analysis of PCR amplified envelope, polymerase, and 3&#x02032; UTR genomic portions from the isolate indicated that this virus belonged to a distinct genetic lineage which included the 1958 prototype POW virus strain and various isolates from Ontario and New York. The PEI strain exhibited greater than 92% nucleotide and 97% amino acid sequence homologies within this genogroup. In contrast, the PEI isolate was up to 15% divergent by nucleotide sequence when compared to a second POW-related genetic lineage comprised of deer tick viruses and other POW-like isolates.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>This POW virus isolate from Atlantic Canada is related to one of two genetic lineages currently circulating in North America. The isolate belongs to the lineage most commonly associated with human disease. Therefore, public health officials should consider POW as part of a differential diagnosis in persons with meningitis or encephalitis and history of exposure to ticks.</p>

        <p>Nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests, and especially PCR, are considered to be the most sensitive methods for the detection of HSV in genital lesions or during asymptomatic shedding. Yet culture isolation is considered the gold standard for HSV identification and it is still the most commonly used method in Canada. In order to quantify the performance of NAA tests in comparison with culture isolation, we performed an analysis of the literature on the subject.</p>

        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A literature search was performed to identify studies dealing with NAA of HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 for diagnostic purposes. The subset of articles showing a comparative analysis with culture isolation for the detection of genital HSV were further analyzed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of NAA relative to culture isolation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>NAA tests are more sensitive than culture isolation under all conditions. Overall the sensitivity of culture relative to NAA is 69.9%. The advantage of NAA tests is particularly obvious for detecting HSV from genital lesions past the vesicular stage and for asymptomatic shedding, where the sensitivity is over 10 fold higher than for culture isolation. The specificity of NAA is virtually 100%, according to the few studies in which specificity was addressed. Real time PCR is the most commonly used method in diagnostics, but a great variety of other PCR- and non-PCR-based approaches have been reported.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Because of their superior sensitivity, NAA tests, and PCR in particular, are the method of choice for detection of HSV in genital herpes diagnosis, especially in cases past the vesicular stage or with atypical lesions.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>In a pandemic, there is a real possibility that commercial reagents will be in short supply, which in turn would impact the availability of laboratory services. The National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg locally produced two monoclonal antibodies to influenza A (HB-64 and HB-65), that are targeted to the matrix protein and the nucleoprotein, respectively, which could be provided if a shortage were to occur. The objective of this study was to determine if these monoclonal antibodies would detect influenza A in nasopharyngeal swab samples.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Three strains of influenza A H3N2 subtype, and one H1N1 subtype were used to determine optimum dilutions of HB-64 and HB-65. To investigate specificity, the monoclonal antibodies were tested against cells infected with influenza B, parainfluenza types 1, 2, 3, and respiratory syncytial virus. Fifty seven samples were prepared from nasopharyngeal swabs submitted to the laboratory from respiratory outbreak investigations during the influenza season of 2005&#x02013;2006. These slides were blind tested, using the two monoclonal antibodies, and the results compared to the original test results with the Dako IMAGEN&#x02122; Influenza A stain.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>No cross reactions were observed with either HB monoclonal antibody. Only HB-65 was evaluated with the outbreak set of slides. One hundred per cent of the influenza A positive clinical samples (12 in total) were detected with HB-65. One sample positive with HB-65 was originally reported negative, but later confirmed positive for Influenza A by NAT testing. Nine samples were inconclusive with HB-65 and reported negative when originally tested. Thirty five samples were negative with HB-65 and in the original result.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>The NML monoclonal HB-65 will detect influenza A infected cells in nasopharyngeal swabs. HB-65 was sensitive and specific in the limited testing performed, but further testing will be required to validate that it can detect a potential pandemic subtype.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>1) To evaluate the performance of Binax NOW&#x000ae; Influenza A&#x00026;B (&#x0201c;NOW&#x0201d;; Binax Inc, Portland, ME) and ImmunoCard STAT!&#x000ae; Flu A&#x00026;B Plus (&#x0201c;ICStat&#x0201d;; Meridian Bioscience Inc, Cincinnati, OH) assays using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) collected and transported with the Starswab&#x000ae; Multitrans System (Starplex Scientific Inc, Etobicoke, ON), and 2) to determine if S160-M, a transport medium not previously evaluated by either manufacturer, has any effect on assay performance.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Prospectively collected (2/15/06&#x02013;4/18/06) NPS from adults (20&#x02013;93 yr) presenting with influenza symptoms to local emergency departments, outpatient offices and clinics, admitted to regional hospitals, or resident in long term care facilities, were processed for DFA and for culture at RVL. Upon receipt, specimens were examined by DFA (Light Diagnostics&#x02122; Influenza A and B monoclonal antibodies (mAbs); Millipore Corp, Temecula CA), and specimens inoculated into cell culture (RMK [DHI Inc, Athens OH]; HFL [CHEO]). Specimens were tested by NOW and ICStat concurrently.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Of 103 specimens tested, 17 were rejected for DFA. <underline>
            <italic>Relative to DFA</italic>
          </underline> (n=86), overall sensitivity and specificity of NOW were 65% (32/49) and 100% (37/37), and of ICStat, were 67.3% (33/49) and 100% (37/37). <underline>

          </underline> (n=103), overall sensitivity and specificity of NOW were 69.8% (30/43) and 95% (57/60), and of ICStat were 74.4% (32/43) and 95% (57/60). <underline>
            <italic>Relative to DFA and/or culture</italic>
          </underline>, Flu A sensitivity and specificity of NOW were 59% and 100%, and for Flu B, 70% and 100%. Flu A sensitivity and specificity of ICStat were 61% and 100%, and for Flu B, 80% and 100%.

      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>For NPS specimens collected from adults, the performance of NOW and ICStat assays was comparable, demonstrating high specificity but poor sensitivity. Our findings are consistent with published data using other, approved media. Therefore, S160-M medium appears to be suitable for use with either of these test kits.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Safety considerations have led many laboratories to replace glass collection vessels with plastic products. At the Regional Virology Laboratory (RVL), a major client routinely submits CSF specimens in Becton-Dickinson (BD) Vacutainer&#x000ae; serum/blood collection tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes NJ), and chose to replace a glass product (BD 366431) with a plastic silicone-coated tube (BD 367815). It is not known whether the silicone coating on these tubes interferes with nucleic acid amplification. Our objective was to investigate the effect of silicone-coated plastic on the recovery and amplification of viral nucleic acid (HSV-1 DNA) from CSF.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Ten-fold dilutions (10<sup>&#x02212;1&#x02013;</sup>10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) of titrated HSV-1 stock were prepared in pooled bland CSF. Each dilution was incubated (4&#x000b0;C) in parallel in glass and in silicone-coated plastic Vacutainer&#x000ae; tubes. At 1, 8, 48, and 96 hours of incubation, samples from each tube type and at each dilution were extracted (Qiagen QIAmp DNA Mini Kit, Qiagen, Mississauga ON) and analyzed by real-time PCR (based on JCM (2002); 40: 2609&#x02013;11). Results (amplification success, C<sub>T</sub> values) obtained from triplicate PCR runs were compared.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>HSV-1 DNA was consistently detected to a 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> dilution of stock virus at all time points, for samples incubated in glass and in plastic Vacutainer&#x000ae; tubes. For each positive specimen, the observed C<sub>T</sub> values were similar, regardless of the Vacutainer&#x000ae; tube type.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>Recovery and amplification of HSV-1 DNA from CSF specimens is not affected by the silicone coating of plastic BD Vacutainer&#x000ae; (367815) tubes. Therefore, plastic silicone-coated tubes are an acceptable alternative to glass collection tubes for this application.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>A number of commercial ELISA kits that detect human norovirus (HuNV) antigens in stool samples have recently appeared in the marketplace. The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of the IDEIA Norovirus EIA from Oxoid (formerly Dako Microbiology) in comparison to RT-PCR for the detection of norovirus in stool samples.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Eighty-one stool specimens from patients with gastroenteri-tis that were tested by RT-PCR were subsequently tested by EIA.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>The sensitivity, specificity, PVP and PVN of the IDEIA Norovirus EIA in comparison to RT-PCR was 73.17%, 80%, 78.95% and 74.42% respectively.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>The results indicate that while the kit does not have the performance characteristics of RT-PCR methods used to detect HuNVs, the assay could be best employed to handle the surge capacity in outbreak situations as a positive screening tool followed by confirmation of the negatives with RT-PCR. It would not be used to test sporadic cases. Of the norovirus ELISAs we have evaluated, the IDEIA Norovirus EIA appears to be the most effective tool.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVES</title>
        <p>Norovirus is a major cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks in hospitals, nursing and residential homes, and other institutional settings. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA), the IDEIA norovirus for detecting norovirus antigens and determining the norovirus genogroup (G1, G2) in faecal samples was evaluated. The performance of the EIA was compared to that of electron microscopy (EM) and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>A panel, comprising 497 faecal samples collected from patients involved in 97 outbreaks of gastroenteritis was used in the evaluation. The panel was represented by 5 outbreaks with a single specimen, 11 with 2 specimens, 12 with 3 specimens, and 69 outbreaks with four or more specimens. Specimens were simultaneously analyzed using EM, EIA and RT-PCR.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Amongst the 97 outbreaks, RT-PCR could detect 85 G2-associated outbreaks and 1 outbreak positive for both G1 and G2. Specimens from 94 outbreaks were tested by EIA with the following results: 67 outbreaks were G2 positive, 5 were G1 and G2 positive, 2 were positive for G1, and 20 outbreaks were negative. EM could detect 49 positive outbreaks and 7 inconclusive; the other 41 outbreaks were negative. When compared to RT-PCR, EIA had a sensitivity and a specificity of 62.9 and 98.0%, respectively while EM had a sensitivity and a specificity of 19.6 and 95.9%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the EIA in detecting norovirus associated outbreaks were 86.9 and 80%, respectively. This compares with a sensitivity and a specificity of 54.6 and 81.8% for electron microscopy.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>EIA has a better sensitivity than EM for detecting norovirus associated outbreaks. The inclusion of screening by EIA in a testing algorithm followed by RT-PCR and EM for EIA negative outbreaks would take advantage of the simplicity of the EIA, the increased sensitivity of the RT-PCR, and the ability of EM in detecting other viruses. The advent of sensitive EIA provides a rapid and simple assay that can be utilized in institutions with high throughput of samples and low expertise in molecular detection methods.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>Surveillance programs for West Nile virus (WNV) in mosquitoes are necessary to inform the general population of high-risk periods and to determine if mosquito eradication programs will be implemented. The objective of this study was to develop a mosquito surveillance program that would monitor the prevalence and spread of (WNV) and would also replace the use of sentinel chicken flocks in West Equine Encephalitis (WEE) surveillance.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Mosquitoes were caught in CO2 traps and sorted according to species before delivery to the lab. Trizol was added to the mosquito pools to stabilize the RNA. The RNeasy kit (Qiagen) was used to extract the mosquito pools. A Taqman RT-PCR protocol was used to detect WNV. Mosquito pools with crossing thresholds greater than 37 were considered negative. Mosquito pools with crossing thresholds of 30&#x02013;37 were re-extracted while those pools with crossing thresholds less than 30 were only re-amplified. All positives were confirmed by TaqMan RT-PCR using two different WNV specific targets: WNV ENV and WNV 3&#x02032;NC. When time permitted the stored extracts were tested for WEE using a Taqman protocol. WEE positives were sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory for confirmation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>During the summers of 2004, 2005 and 2006, 4170 mosquito pools were tested. Over these three summers 205 mosquito pools were initially positive for WNV. Of these, 198/2363 were <italic>C tarsalis</italic> pools whereas 7/1807 were non-tarsalis pools. Using the confirmation algorithm 175 of these mosquito pools were confirmed positives for WNV. This protocol allowed 85.37% of initial positives to be confirmed. In 2004, two <italic>C tarsalis</italic> pools tested positive for WEE, both of which were confirmed positive by the National Microbiology Laboratory.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
        <p>WNV can be monitored successfully in our region using a mosquito surveillance program that is restricted to <italic>C tarsalis</italic> species. The appearance of WNV in <italic>C tarsalis</italic> species predates human cases. The WEE can be detected in a <italic>C tarsalis</italic> surveillance program.</p>

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p>Enteroviruses (and Parechoviruses) are a constantly changing group of quasi-species of RNA viruses with high mutation and recombination rates. Aside from Polioviruses, which we must remain vigilant in screening for, various other viruses in this group can cause serious illness. The ability to quickly type positive specimens, either directly or after cell culturing is of major importance not only for patient care but also for public health surveillance.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing of amplicons covering the VP1 region has been shown to be an accurate, relatively rapid and broad-spectrum method for typing of Enteroviruses/Parechoviruses which correlates to older serological methods as well as recognizing types not adaptable to cell culture and an ever increasing number of newly classified Enteroviruses. (ex Oberste et al 2003 J Clin Virol 26:375)</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Over the past three years (2004&#x02013;2006), we have received specimens from seven provinces, typed as 40 different viruses including two Sabin vaccine strain-related Poliviruses. The predominant types submitted include Echo 18, Echo 5, CoxA16, Echo 6, Echo 9 and Parechovirus type I. We will present some phylogenetic analysis based on recent submissions.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>While cell culture remains an important aspect to testing for Enteroviruses, subsequent or concurrent typing by molecular sequencing offers many advantages including the ability to detect and type viruses which do not grow in cell culture, or which may have mutated enough to escape standard antibody typing methods. Our reference lab uses molecular typing of Enteroviruses not only to help in the typing of any Poliovirus isolates, but also as a reference service to provinces for the typing of other isolates as needed. This method can provide valuable data for outbreak analysis and virus surveillance.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To compare the detection of HSV type-specific antibody by the University of Washington Western blot assay and the Focus Diagnostics Herpselect ELISAs.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>The herpes type specific Western blot assay was implemented in the laboratory based on the method used at the University of Washington. The assay used ATCC seed stocks of HSV-1 and HSV-2 to produce infected cell lysates which served both as antigens after SDS-PAGE and Bblotting as well as antigens bound to Sepharose beads for cross-absorption of sera. The focus Focus Diagnostics HerpeSelect ELISA is a standard 96-well plate ELISA based on the recombinant HSV gG-2 antigens. The Western blots were read and interpreted by at least two individuals. For validation, the sera were also tested by Western blot at the National Microbiology Laboratory.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>155 serums were tested by both HSV WB and Focus HSV-1 and HSV-2 ELISAs. Of these the findings on 135 specimens were fully concordant. Findings on 20 specimens were discordant with the ELISA generally detecting antibody to both HSV-1 and HSV-1 when the Western blot detected antibody to a single HSV. For these discordant specimens, the NML findings were overall concordant with the ELISA findings. Of the sera tested, 68 had antibody to HSV-1, 27 to HSV 2, 33 to both HSV 1&#x00026;2 and 7 had no detectable antibody to HSV.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>There were overall good correlation between the findings obtained by the HerpeSelect tests and the HSV WB. Antibody in sera to HSV-2 was detected more readily by the HerpeSelect assay and antibody to HSV-1 was detected more readily by WB. The HerpeSelect assays are easier and faster to perform and it can accommodate more specimens per run than the WB assay.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>The Huh-7 cell line (human hepatoma) has been successfully used for the propagation of hepatitis viruses. We explored the ability of this cell line for the replication of enteroviruses.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>The growth of a variety of enteroviruses in Huh-7 cells, MRC5 cells and primary rhesus Monkey Kidney cells was compared using virus stocks provided by the National Microbiology Laboratory. The stock viruses were subjected to ten-fold serial dilution and inoculated in duplicate into the respective cell cultures which were monitored for the development of a cytopathic effect.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>All viruses tested grew in Huh-7 cell cultures. In Huh-7 cells viruses that grew from the highest dilution included CVB3, CVB4, CVB5, EV68, PV2 and PV3. In MRC5 cells viruses that grew from highest dilution included CVA2, CVA9, CVA16, CVA20, CVA21, EV1, EV2, EV5, EV6, EV11, EV19, EV25, EV29, EV30. In RMK cells the viruses that grew from the highest dilution included CVB2 and EV4. Viruses EV2, EV3, and EV15 grew in MRC5 and Huh-7 cells from a higher dilution. Likewise viruses EV1, EV9 and EV14 grew in MRC5 and RMK cells at the same higher dilution. The cytopathic effect was very easy to read in Huh-7 cells which makes these promising for plaque assays</p>

        <title>DISCUSSION</title>
        <p>Huh-7 was shown to be an effective cell line for culturing a wide variety of enteroviruses and promises to be a useful line for virus isolation.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>We have shown previously that IgG avidity determination may be useful in differentiating cases with recent West Nile virus (WNV) infection from those with historical infection and persistent IgM antibodies. We have used a commercial IFA assay to determine IgG avidity for two WNV seasons. We evaluated the performance of a commercial IgG avidity EIA.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>79 specimens positive for WNV IgM antibodies, including paired acute and convalescent specimens from 16 patients, were studied. The presence of WNV-specific IgG and avidity determination was performed using an IFA (Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany) according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. Avidity was determined by reference to control slides and was recorded as low, indeterminate or high. All specimens were also tested using an IgG avidity EIA (Euroimmun). Avidity was expressed as an avidity index; values of &#x0003c;40% were regarded as low avidity, 40&#x02013;60% as indeterminate and &#x0003e;60% as high avidity.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>When tested by IFA, 13 specimens were IgG-negative and 63 were IgG-positive. The avidity of IgG antibodies was high in 17 IgG-positive specimens (27%), intermediate in 4 and low in 42 (67%). Seroconversion from IgG negative to positive was demonstrated in 7 of 16 patients with paired sera. Overall, historical exposure to WNV was suspected in 21.5% of specimens. When the same specimens were tested using ELISA, the mean avidity index of specimens with high avidity, indeterminate, and low avidity were 81, 13, and 18 respectively. Three high-avidity samples gave indeterminate AI and two specimens with low avidity by IFA were borderline high avidity by EIA.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Using IgG avidity to classify WNV IgM-positive patients as either recent or historical cases has allowed us to concentrate public health investigations more appropriately. Our recent experience has been with an IFA avidity assays, but these data show that an ELISA avidity assay would perform equally well, if large volume testing were necessary.</p>

      <p>An 11 year old boy with Crohn's disease who had immigrated from Lebanon 2 years prior presented to a paediatric hospital following a progressive illness characterized by intermittent fevers, increasing fatigue and malaise, and anorexia/weight loss. In the emergency department he had a fever of 39&#x000b0;C and was found to be quite thin with splenomegaly. He had a pancytopenia with a leukocyte count of 2.4, hemoglobin of 91 and platelet count of 107. Blood, stool, and urine cultures were taken and he was started on piperacillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole. Cultures were negative and he continued to have daily temperature spikes up to 40&#x000b0;C. An abdominal ultrasound was negative other than severe splenomegaly (with the tip of the spleen extending into the pelvic brim) and moderate hepatomegaly. A bone marrow aspirate was done after one week that showed no organisms on staining and no growth on fungal, bacterial, and mycobacterial cultures. Antibiotics were stopped with no change in fever pattern.</p>
      <p>Computerized tomography (CT) scan with contrast of the boy's abdomen revealed multiple hypodensities in the spleen and liver consistent with small abscesses. Two weeks following admission a liver biopsy was taken. No organisms were seen on staining and mycobacterial and fungal cultures were negative.</p>

      <p>A 29-year-old migrant farm worker from Mexico presented to hospital with fever of unknown origin. She had travelled to Canada six weeks previously to work at an orchard and had been feeling well at that time. One week later she developed rigors with drenching sweats, and intermittent epigastric and thoracic back pain. She had no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. She subsequently developed vaginal sores and was diagnosed with genital herpes simplex and secondary bacterial infection, but the fevers did not resolve with appropriate treatment. There was no history of insect bites, sick contacts, or high-risk sexual activity. She had lived in close proximity to chickens in Mexico but there was no other recent animal contact. Her husband was said to have died of lung cancer at the age of 27. Physical examination was significant for fever, tachypnea, umbilicated papules on the eyelid, and white lesions in oropharynx. Examination of the chest was normal. Laboratory investigations showed anemia, leukopenia, mildly elevated liver enzymes, and high lactate dehy-drogenase. Chest x-ray showed a diffuse reticulonodular pattern. Further diagnostic testing was performed.</p>

      <p>An otherwise healthy 46-year-old male, with no significant past medical history, presented to the dermatology clinic for assessment of three weeks history of non-tender, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. Additionally he reported a six-week history of intermittent fever, chills, night sweats, weakness, and mild polyarthralgia. He denied arthritis or other associated symptoms, ill contacts, and recent travel outside of the United States and Canada.</p>
      <p>When seen by dermatology, the rash was felt to be atypical so a skin biopsy was performed. The patient was started empirically on oral cloxacillin and referred for assessment by infectious diseases.</p>
      <p>On exam, the patient looked well, was afebrile, and had normal vital signs. Examination of the skin revealed a widespread eruption localized predominantly to the lower legs and arms with involvement of the palms. The lesions consisted of individual erythematous non-blanching macules and papules with a predominantly follicular distribution. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. He had no mucous membrane lesions, no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy and no cardiac murmur. Laboratory investigations revealed a total leukocyte count of 11.2&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L with a normal differential, normal renal function and transaminases, a normal urinalysis and an ESR of 71 and CRP of 120. Preliminary results of the skin biopsy revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis consistent with a small-vessel vasculitis.</p>

      <p>A 59 yr old female who is a resident of Seychelles off the Indian Coast presented with an acute onset of fevers of 38.1 degrees Celsius and painful and swollen joints involving both wrists, both knees, and both shoulders with the right shoulder being most affected of 2 weeks duration. She was visiting Canada, to attend her mother's funeral, and left Seychelles 3 weeks ago. She had been treated for swollen and and painful kness through an outpatient clinic with ibuprofen with some relief, but presented with worsening pain and immobility of the right shoulder joint. The knees were the first joints involved followed by wrists and then her shoulders. Her past medical history was only relevant for epilepsy; she was currently not on any medications. Review of systems was negative for rash, or other systemic symptoms. Family history was relevant in her son and father having similar symptoms. Her examination was relevant for effused and warm right shoulder joint, the remaining joints were within normal limit. There was no visible rash. Routine bloodwork showed a WBC 6.9, hemoglobin 127, platelets 331, ALT 38 rheumatoid factor of 21, ANA negative, malaria screen was negative. What further tests would lead you to a diagnosis?</p>

      <p>A previously healthy 41 year old Caucasian woman from Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, began experiencing right eye floaters in mid-August of 2006. She was transferred to a regional hospital for ophthalmological assessment. Fundoscopy showed only posterior vitreous detachment. Re-examination in 2 weeks revealed reduced visual acuity and panuveitis. Topical steroids were ineffective. At third assessment, the ophthalmologist noted poor vision (acuity 20/400), vitritis, chorioretinal hemorrhages and a 3 mm segmented, foreign object within the vitreous cavity which moved subretinally in response to light. No sub-retinal tracks were visible but entry/exit sites were present in the retina.</p>

      <p>A 17 year old male was transferred from a community hospital, in January 2006, for suspicion of leukemia. He had a week long history of high fever to 40&#x000b0;C and a sore throat. After 5 days of fever, he presented to a community hospital where he was empirically started on broad spectrum antibiotics for suspicion of sepsis. Since he did not respond to treatment and the blood, throat and urine cultures drawn prior to antibiotics remained negative, he was transferred to our hospital. His history revealed that he immigrated with his family from Albania 9 months ago but had not traveled since. There was no other sick people among his family and friends. He had no pets here but had a cat and drank un-pasteurized milk while living in Albania. There was no known contact with TB. He is not sexually active, doesn&#x02019;t consume alcohol or illicit drugs. Two months prior to admission, he was seen in another hospital for epistaxis. His CBC had shown low platelets (121&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L), borderline WBC (2.2&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L) and HB (121 g/L). He was referred to pediatric hematology but at time of admission, that visit was still pending. The physical exam showed a febrile, ill looking thin young man with a stable blood pressure and pulse. He had impressive hepatosplenomegaly but no significant adenopathy. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable. His labs revealed a pancytopenia (WBC 1.2&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L, neutrophils 0.6&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L, HB 73 g/L, platelets 98&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L) but no blasts on smear. Liver enzymes were increased (ALT 500 U/L, AST 200 U/L, GGT and bilirubin normal, LDH 643 U/L) and ferritin was very high (3672 &#x003bc;g/L). Total protein were 70 g/L while the albumin was low at 14 g/L. Triglycerides were increased at 3.63 mmol/L. Ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen revealed only an homogenous hepatosplenomegaly. Upon arrival, given the neutropenia and the high fever, broad spectrum antibiotics (Timentin and tobramycin) were continued. The day after his admission, a diagnostic test was performed.</p>

        <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
        <p>To alert physicians to the diagnosis of cutaneous coccidiomycosis in the apparent absence of pulmonary disease.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>METHODS</title>
        <p>Case report: A 24-year-old previously healthy woman presented with a non-healing cutaneous ulcer of over 6 weeks&#x02019; duration, initially associated with 48 hours of systemic symptoms, which had failed to respond to oral antibiotics or topical antifungals. Three days before the lesion's appearance she had travelled by car through California's San Joaquin Valley. Past medical history was negative except for atopic dermatitis treated with intermittent topical steroids. There was no history of animal exposure, known TB contacts, or HIV risk factors. On examination the pertinent findings were: a 2&#x000d7;5 cm cutaneous ulcer located dorsal to the R axilla with a surrounding border of erythema and induration and an enlarged lymph node in the contralateral axilla, and sparse red pruritic papules on the knees. Chest was clear and she was afebrile. CXR was normal. CBC, differential, LFTs and creatinine were within normal limits. CRP was elevated at 17.64.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RESULTS</title>
        <p>Culture revealed light growth of a fungus, presumptively identified by the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control as <italic>Coccidoides immitis</italic>, with subsequent confirmation by DNA probe at the National Centre for Mycology, Edmonton, Alberta. The patient was started on fluconazole 400 mg po daily, with improvement noted at initial follow-up 3 weeks later. Total planned duration of treatment was 3&#x02013;12 months.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>
          <italic>Coccidiodes immitis</italic> may present as a cutaneous lesion in the absence of evidence of preceding pulmonary disease.

    <body>
      <p>A 15-year-old boy presented with periumbilical abdominal pain, occasionally-bloody diarrhea, vomiting and fever of three days duration following immigration to Nova Scotia from West Africa, where he had lived in refugee camps for over a decade. Examination was remarkable for fever (40.7&#x000b0;C), thin body habitus (height and weight below the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile for age), scleral icterus, and hepatosplenomegally (liver palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin, span 11 cm; spleen tip 5 cm below the left costal margin). The abdomen was soft and bowel sounds were heard. He was treated empirically for enteric fever and malaria. He defervesced and the enteric symptoms resolved. Imaging of the liver and spleen showed a normal-looking liver but revealed the presence of three splenic masses. A CT identified two cystic lesions diagnosed as peripheral splenic infarcts, and one large non-cystic mass that seemed to originate in the spleen and extend out of the spleen. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
